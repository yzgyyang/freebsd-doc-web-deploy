	  <b>Subject:</b> Security Incident on FreeBSD Infrastructure<br clear="none" />

	  <p>On Sunday 11th of November, an intrusion was detected on two
	    machines within the FreeBSD.org cluster.  The affected machines
	    were taken offline for analysis.  Additionally, a large portion
	    of the remaining infrastructure machines were also taken offline
	    as a precaution.</p>

	  <p>We have found no evidence of any modifications that would put
	    any end user at risk.  However, we do urge all users to read the
	    report available at
	    <a href="/news/2012-compromise.html" shape="rect">http://www.freebsd.org/news/2012-compromise.html</a>
	    and decide on any required actions themselves.  We will continue
	    to update that page as further information becomes known.  We do
	    not currently believe users have been affected given current
	    forensic analysis, but we will provide updated information if
	    this changes.</p>
   
	  <p>As a result of this event, a number of operational security
	    changes are being made at the FreeBSD Project, in order to
	    further improve our resilience to potential attacks.  We plan,
	    therefore, to more rapidly deprecate a number of legacy services,
	    such as cvsup distribution of FreeBSD source, in favour of our
	    more robust Subversion, freebsd-update, and portsnap models.</p>

	  <p>More information is available at
	    <a href="/news/2012-compromise.html" shape="rect">http://www.freebsd.org/news/2012-compromise.html</a></p>

      restoration of binary package building in the last few weeks.
      This has brought us back the continuous updates for the old-style
      binary packages on the 8.x and 9.x -STABLE branches.  Note that,
      as beneficial consequences, Release Candidate builds for the 8.4
      release cycle can now include binary packages on the install
      media, and the Project was able to add the missing binary packages
      retroactively for 9.1-RELEASE on i386 and amd64 platforms.</p>

    <p>Port managers are currently working on introducing new-style (as
      known as <q>pkgng</q>) binary packages in the coming months,
      please check the <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-ports-announce/" shape="rect">
	FreeBSD ports announcements list</a> for further gradual status
      updates.</p>

    <p>This is planned to be the last status update to this page.  An
      official announcement will be sent to the <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-announce/" shape="rect">
	FreeBSD announcements mailing list</a> with the further details
      soon.</p>

    <h1><a name="update20130323" shape="rect" id="update20130323">Update: March 23rd, 2013</a></h1>

    <p>Port managers have successfully restored some of the Project's
      binary package building capacity.  There are some issues left
      still to resolve, e.g.  how to publish the resulting package sets
      in a secure manner or how to build packages seamlessly for 8.x and
      9.x systems on a recent 10.x system that the head node
      ("pointyhat") is running, but we are very close to finish with the
      preparations required for providing binary packages for the
      upcoming 8.4 and further releases.</p>

    <h1><a name="update20130302" shape="rect" id="update20130302">Update: March 3rd, 2013</a></h1>

    <p>Redports underwent a full security audit, and as a result could
      be brought back on line.  This took place on the 5th February, and
      since then more backend hardware has been added to bring it back
      up to full strength.  On 11th February, sanity checks for ports
      have been turned back on, reenabling generation and update of the
      INDEX files used.  The portsnap(8) service has been switched from
      CVS to SVN on 25th February.  The binary package building
      infrastructure has undergone a major security review, and as a
      result many changes have been made to the code.  The review
      completed on the 16th February and we are now in the process of
      bringing it up on new hardware.  At this point, we expect new
      binary packages to be available in 2-4 weeks.</p>

    <h1><a name="update20121229" shape="rect" id="update20121229">Update: December 29th, 2012</a></h1>

    <p>With the exception of systems relating to the building and testing
      of packages, all FreeBSD.org infrastructure has now been brought
      back online.  A full audit of the third party package build
      infrastructure code ("pointyhat") and package testing infrastructure
      ("redports") continues, and neither system will be brought back
      online until audits are complete.</p>

    <p>As a result, FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE will be published with only
      minimal i386 and amd64 (x86_64) precompiled package sets available,
      and with no packages available for other architectures.  This
      package set will be available on the DVD image, and are sufficient
      to install either the GNOME or the KDE desktop environment.  For any
      other uses, or for any packages not included on the CD, either
      using the most recently available -stable package collection or
      compiling ports from the ports tree are recommended.  Packages
      for 9.1-RELEASE will be made available at a later date.  Instructions
      for obtaining and updating the ports tree can be found in the
      <a href="/doc/handbook/ports-using.html" shape="rect">
        FreeBSD Handbook</a>.</p>

    <h1><a name="update20121127" shape="rect" id="update20121127">Update: November 27th, 2012</a></h1>

    <p>Due to the legacy third-party package build controller head
      nodes being offlined pending reinstall, we have been unable to
      build new package sets over the last two weeks.  As a result,
      FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE has been delayed as it was felt that we
      should not ship the release without at least a minimal package
      set available.  We are now in a position where we are once
      again able to build third-party packages for both of our
      <a href="/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/committers-guide/archs.html" shape="rect">
	Tier-1 architectures</a> (i386 and amd64), and are planning on
      releasing it within the next few days with only a slightly
      limited set of packages.  Please note that historically we have
      also provided packages on a best-effort basis for some of our
      Tier-2 architectures such as sparc64, ia64 and powerpc.  We are
      not currently expecting to be in a position to build any Tier-2
      packages before FreeBSD 9.1 ships, so initially no precompiled
      packages will be available for these platforms.  We
      may be in a position to provide some packages for these
      architectures shortly after the release.</p>

    <p>A few reports covering this incident on external tech news
      websites have confused details relating to how this incident
      was discovered.  Over the last few weeks, many of our primary
      cluster servers have been either physically relocated and/or
      replaced with new hardware as part of work planned several
      months in advance.  The discovery of this incident was
      unrelated to this ongoing cluster maintenance.  Several
      service outages in the days surrounding the incident were
      correctly attributed to ongoing cluster work, and were not
      related in any way to the compromise.  In parallel with the
      physical upgrades and relocation of servers, we are also
      reworking the network layout in order to provide better
      functionality, security, resilience, and to reduce any impact
      from incidents such as this.  Due in a large part to the
      progress already made here, we were able to have full
      confidence in many systems and services so quickly after the
      compromised hosts on the legacy network segment were
      discovered.</p>

    <h1><a name="update20121122" shape="rect" id="update20121122">Update: November 22nd, 2012</a></h1>

    <p>Although not mentioned in the original report,
      <a href="/doc/handbook/ctm.html" shape="rect">CTM</a> (another mechanism for
      retrieving FreeBSD source) uses the master trusted Subversion
      repository as the source of its data.  Additionally, verification of
      CTM-sourced trees has been completed against the Subversion tree,
      confirming that there are no differences between the two.  Our
      experimental Git repository has been similarly verified.</p>

    <p>Work continues on rebuilding internal infrastructure and reinstating
      services taken down during the incident.  Web interfaces to the old
      CVS repositories (CVSweb), and to GNATS (our bug-tracking database)
      have been restored amongst other services, and other internal hosts
      are being examined and rebuilt where necessary.  A full audit of the
      package building infrastructure is ongoing.</p>

    <p>The FreeBSD Project is investing significant effort into looking
      into both medium and long term infrastructure improvements to increase
      security of the FreeBSD cluster.</p>

    <h1><a name="update20121118" shape="rect" id="update20121118">Update: November 18th, 2012</a></h1>

    <p>Newer portsnap(8) snapshots are once again available.  The
      generation of these had been suspended as part of the infrastructure
      lockdown, however all machines involved have either been audited or
      reinstalled and so we are now confident that these can be made
      available once more.</p>

    <p>The Subversion to CVS exporter is now up and running again.
      Updates made to the Subversion repository will once again appear in
      repositories available via csup/CVSup.  Please note that the use of
      these exports are still deprecated, and users are urged to move to
      one of the supported methods (for example, freebsd-update(8),
      portsnap(8), or Subversion) in order to obtain updates.  Note also
      that we are still currently unable to guarantee the integrity of
      past history within the CVS repository, but are confident in the
      integrity of checkouts from the top-of-tree of each branch.</p>

    <p>Please note that due to infrastructure changes, the first update
      through either portsnap(8) or csup(1) is likely to show changes to
      a large number of files.  This is nothing to worry about.</p>

    <p>As mentioned in the original announcement, a package set uploaded in
      preparation for the upcoming FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE could not be verified,
      and so was removed.  In order to allow system integrators and end
      users to verify that packages they may have downloaded are not from
      this set, we have provided files containing both
      <a href="/news/2012-compromise/sha256.sums.20121118.txt" shape="rect">sha256</a> and
      <a href="/news/2012-compromise/md5.sums.20121118.txt" shape="rect">md5</a> checksums
      for all removed packages.</p>

    <h1><a name="details" shape="rect" id="details">November 17th, 2012</a></h1>
    <h2>Initial details</h2>

    <p>On Sunday 11th November 2012, two machines within the FreeBSD.org
      infrastructure were found to have been compromised.  These machines
      were head nodes for the legacy third-party package building
      infrastructure.  It is believed that the compromise may have occurred
      as early as the 19th September 2012.</p>

    <p>The compromise is believed to have occurred due to the leak of an
      SSH key from a developer who legitimately had access to the machines
      in question, and was not due to any vulnerability or code exploit
      within FreeBSD.</p>

    <p>To understand the impact of this compromise, you must first
      understand that the FreeBSD operating system is divided into two
      parts: the "base" maintained by the FreeBSD community, and a large
      collection of third-party "packages" distributed by the Project.
      The kernel, system libraries, compiler, core command-line tools
      (e.g., SSH client), and daemons (e.g., sshd(8)) are all in the
      "base".  Most information in this advisory refers only to
      third-party packages distributed by the Project.</p>

    <p>No part of the base FreeBSD system has been put at risk.  At no
      point has the intruder modified any part of the FreeBSD base system
      software in any way.  However, the attacker had access sufficient
      to potentially allow the compromise of third-party packages.  No
      evidence of this has been found during in-depth analysis, however
      the FreeBSD Project is taking an extremely conservative view on this
      and is working on the assumption that third-party packages generated
      and distributed within a specific window could theoretically have
      been modified.</p>

    <h2><a name="impact" shape="rect" id="impact">What is the Impact?</a></h2>

    <p>If you are running a system that has had no third-party packages
      installed or updated on it between the 19th September and 11th
      November 2012, you have no reason to worry.</p>

    <p>The Source, Ports and Documentation Subversion repositories have been
      audited, and we are confident that no changes have been made to them.
      Any users relying on them for updates have no reason to worry.</p>

    <p>We have verified the state of FreeBSD packages and releases currently
      available on ftp.FreeBSD.org.  All package sets for existing versions
      of FreeBSD and all available releases have been validated and we can
      confirm that the currently available packages and releases have not
      been modified in any way.</p>

    <p>A package set for the upcoming FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE had been uploaded
      to the FTP distribution sites in preparation for 9.1-RELEASE.  We are
      unable to verify the integrity of this package set, and therefore it
      has been removed and will be rebuilt.  Please note that as these
      packages were for a future release, the standard <q>pkg_add -r</q>
      tools to install packages could not have downloaded these packages
      unless they were requested explicitly.</p>

    <p>We unfortunately cannot guarantee the integrity of any packages
      available for installation between 19th September 2012 and 11th
      November 2012, or of any ports compiled from trees obtained via any
      means other than through svn.freebsd.org or one of its mirrors.
      Although we have no evidence to suggest any tampering took place
      and believe such interference is unlikely, we have to recommend you
      consider reinstalling any machine from scratch, using trusted
      sources.</p>

    <p>We can confirm that the freebsd-update(8) binary upgrade mechanism is
      unaffected, as it uses an entirely separate infrastructure.  We have
      also verified that the most recently-available portsnap(8) snapshot
      matches the ports Subversion repository, and so can be fully trusted.
      Please note that as a precaution, newer portsnap(8) snapshots are
      currently not being generated.</p>

    <h2><a name="done" shape="rect" id="done">What has FreeBSD.org done about this?</a></h2>

    <p>As soon as the incident came to light, the FreeBSD Cluster
      Administration team took the following actions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Power down the compromised machines.</li>
      <li>Power down all machines on which the attacker may have had
        access.</li>
      <li>Audit the SVN and Perforce repositories to:
	<ul>
	  <li>Verify that there had been no server intrusion.</li>
	  <li>Verify that no malicious commits had been made to the
	    repository.</li>
	  <li>Verify that the SVN repository exactly matched a known-clean
	    off-site copy.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      <li>Verify that all FreeBSD base release media and install files on
	the master FTP distribution sites are clean.</li>
      <li>Verify all package sets available have checksums that match
	known-good copies stored off-site.</li>
      <li>The package set built for the upcoming 9.1-RELEASE did not have
	an offsite backup to verify against.  These have been deleted, and
	will be rebuilt before 9.1 is released.</li>
      <li>All suspect machines are being either reinstalled, retired, or
	thoroughly audited before being brought back online.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="recommend" shape="rect" id="recommend">At this time, we recommend:</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>If you use the already-deprecated cvsup/csup distribution
	mechanisms, you should stop now.</li>
      <li>If you were using cvsup/csup for ports, you should switch to
	portsnap(8) right away.  Ports developers should be using
	Subversion already.  Further information on preferred mechanisms
	for obtaining and updating the ports tree can be found at
	<a href="/doc/handbook/ports-using.html" shape="rect">
	  http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html</a></li>
      <li>If you were using cvs/anoncvs/cvsup/csup for src, you should
	consider either freebsd-update(8) for signed binary distribution
	or Subversion for source.  Please see the chapter on <a href="/doc/handbook/updating-upgrading.html" shape="rect">updating
	FreeBSD from source</a> in the handbook.  Further details on
	using Subversion and a list of official mirrors can be found
	at <a href="/doc/handbook/svn.html" shape="rect">
	  http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/svn.html</a></li>
      <li>If you use portsnap(8), you should <tt>portsnap fetch &amp;&amp;
	portsnap extract</tt> to the most recent snapshot.  The most recent
	portsnap(8) snapshot has been verified to exactly match the audited
	Subversion repository.  Please note that as a precaution, portsnap(8)
	updates have been suspended temporarily.</li>
      <li>Follow best practice security policies to determine how your
	organization may be affected.</li>
      <li>Conduct an audit of your system that uses FreeBSD.org provided
	binary packages. Anything that may have been installed during the
	affected period should be considered suspect.  Although we have no
	evidence of any tampering of any packages, you may wish to consider
	rebuilding any affected machine from scratch, or if that is not
	possible, rebuild your ports/packages.</li>
      </ul>

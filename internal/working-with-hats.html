          <div id="contentwrap"><h1>Working with Hats</h1>

    <p>Warner Losh, member of the core team as of the writing of the lines
      below, points out the following considerations and practices
      when working with hats:</p>

    <p>This is not an official statement from core, but rather one
      core member's personal interpretation of core's position, both
      as a sitting member of core and as a former security
      officer.  This is only a guideline, not as a cudgel for
      grievances.  Much like style(9) is a guideline for the
      source code, this document is not intended as an absolute
      straight jacket.</p>

    <p>When core appoints someone to a hat, they expect that person
      to be responsible for an area of the source code tree.  Core
      expects that person to be the final authority in that area of the
      tree, or have enough self knowledge to know that they are not and
      to seek qualified help.  Core expects that person to guide
      development in that area of the tree.  Sometimes this means taking
      an pro-active role in day to day affairs, while other times this
      means taking a reactive role in reviewing committed code.</p>

    <p>When people submit patches that potentially impact this area
      of the tree, core expects the hat or his appointed deputies to
      review the patches appropriately.  Core expects that the hat will
      work with the patch submitter to correct issues that there may be
      with the patches.  Core expects the hat to offer solutions and
      work with the submitter to reach a compromise.  Core expects the
      hat to be courteous.  It is reasonable for hats to request that
      normal project rules be followed when reviewing patches (for example,
      that they generally conform to style(9) or the prevailing style of the
      file, that style and content changes be separated.).</p>

    <p>When a dispute arises, core expects the hat to make his or her
      best efforts to compromise or otherwise resolve the dispute.  The
      hat is expected to be courteous to all parties involved.  In
      extreme cases, core recognizes that hats may need to wield a big
      stick and say "no, that is not acceptable and cannot go in
      (or must be backed out)." Core views this last power as one
      of last resort, and would frown on hats using that either too
      often or as the first response.</p>

    <p>Often real life interferes with a hat's ability to perform their
      duties.  A condition that core generally imposes upon the hats of
      the world is that they have a deputy that can act in their absence.
      This deputy is expected to be an active participant in the team that
      the hat puts together and should be conversant with all the issues
      that surround the part of the tree that the hat is guiding.  The
      deputy is expected to be able to act in the absence of the hat.
      For example, the security officer deputies send out security
      advisories when the SO is not around.  In extreme cases, the
      deputy can defer an issue until the hat returns, but that is
      expected to be the exception rather than the rule, especially if
      the hat's return is far in the future.</p>

    <p>Hats are answerable to core.  If they are doing good jobs,
      core will leave them alone.  If they are doing a bad job, core has
      the option to remove them.  Hats are expected to work with core if
      core has issues with their performance of their duties.  They serve
      at the pleasure of core.</p>

    <p>Core sometimes will impose additional, specific requirements
      for a given hat that do not apply to all hats.  These conditions
      may change over time.</p>

    <p>Committers and others working with hats are expected to use
      common sense, and be polite to the hats.  They are expected to
      work with the hat and his team to come to a solution acceptable to
      everybody.  In the event that no compromise can be reached, the
      committers are expected to accept the decisions of the hat with
      good grace.  In exceptional cases, these decisions can be appealed
      to core.  However, core generally will not override the decisions
      of the hats that it appoints unless the hat acted in bad faith or
      arbitrarily.  Core is not a technical review board, and has
      created the hats as mini-TRBs to give dispute resolution a proper
      framework.</p>

    <p>If a committer feels that a hat is abusing his or her power,
      or being regularly rude to contributors, then they should bring
      the matter to core.  This problem can be technical, social,
      procedural, or some combination or subset of these.  Core will hear
      the case and reach a decision, and expects both sides to abide by
      their decision.  Core appreciates specific complaints rather than
      general ones as those are easier to resolve.</p>

    <p>Core expects committers to work together in the appropriate
      mailing lists to resolve their issues.  The hat and his team
      should be relatively rarely involved in their role as hat, and
      instead should usually be just another committer.  (The one
      exception to this is the security officer hat, which needs to
      secretly solve vulnerabilities before they are announced.)  The
      hat should be a "first among equals," not a chairman.</p>

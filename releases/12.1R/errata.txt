   Abstract

   This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE, containing
   significant information discovered after the release or too late in the
   release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation. This
   information includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the
   software or documentation that could affect its operation or usability. An
   up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before
   installing this version of FreeBSD.

   This errata document for FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE will be maintained until the
   release of FreeBSD 12.2-RELEASE.

1. Introduction

   This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD
   12.1-RELEASE Before installing this version, it is important to consult
   this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that
   may already have been found and fixed.

   Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release
   (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition,
   but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted
   as the "current errata" for this release. These other copies of the errata
   are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which
   keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

   Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 12-STABLE also contain up-to-date
   copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

   For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see

4. Open Issues

     * [2019-11-04] A late issue was discovered where systems using the
       graphics/drm-kmod port built on FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE will crash during
       boot. It is advised to remove the port prior to upgrading, and build
       the port instead of using the upstream binary package.

5. Late-Breaking News

     * [2019-11-22] The FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE announcement includes mention of
       FreeBSD/amd64 Amazon(R) EC2(TM) AMIs (Amazon Machine Images). Though
       it also included mention of FreeBSD/aarch64 being available in various
       regions, it had not passed third-party validation for inclusion in the
       Amazon(R) Marketplace.

       FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE aarch64 Amazon(R) EC2(TM) AMIs are now available
       in the Marketplace here.

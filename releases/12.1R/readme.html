      12.1-RELEASE, the latest point along the 12-STABLE
      branch.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp44956408"></a>1.1. About FreeBSD</h3></div></div></div><p>FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite for
	AMD64 and Intel EM64T based PC hardware (amd64), Intel,
	AMD, Cyrix or NexGen <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">x86</span>&#8221;</span> based PC hardware
	(i386), and <span class="trademark">UltraSPARC</span>® machines (sparc64).
	Versions for the <span class="trademark">ARM</span>® (arm), <span class="trademark">MIPS</span>® (mips), and
	<span class="trademark">PowerPC</span>® (powerpc) architectures are currently under
	development as well.  FreeBSD works with a wide variety of
	peripherals and configurations and can be used for everything
	from software development to games to Internet Service
	Provision.</p><p>This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need to run
	such a system, including full source code for the kernel and
	all utilities in the base distribution.  With the source
	distribution installed, you can literally recompile the entire
	system from scratch with one command, making it ideal for
	students, researchers, or users who simply want to see how it
	all works.</p><p>A large collection of third-party ported software (the
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Ports Collection</span>&#8221;</span>) is also provided to make it
	easy to obtain and install all your favorite traditional
	<span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® utilities for FreeBSD.  Each <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">port</span>&#8221;</span> consists
	of a set of scripts to retrieve, configure, build, and install
	a piece of software, with a single command.  Over
	24,000 ports, from editors to programming languages to
	graphical applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and comprehensive
	operating environment that extends far beyond what's provided
	by many commercial versions of <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>®.  Most ports are also
	available as pre-compiled <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">packages</span>&#8221;</span>, which can
	be quickly installed from the installation program.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp44990072"></a>1.2. Target Audience</h3></div></div></div><p>This release is aimed
	primarily at early adopters and various other users who want
	to get involved with the ongoing development of FreeBSD.  While
	the FreeBSD development team tries its best to ensure that each
	release works as advertised, 12-STABLE is very
	much a work-in-progress.</p><p>The basic requirements for using
	this release are technical proficiency with FreeBSD and an
	understanding of the ongoing development process of FreeBSD
	12-STABLE (as discussed on the <a class="link" href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current" target="_top">FreeBSD-CURRENT mailing list</a>).</p><p>For those more interested in doing
	business with FreeBSD than in experimenting with new FreeBSD
	technology, formal releases (such as 11.3-RELEASE)
	are frequently more appropriate.  Releases undergo a period of
	testing and quality assurance checking to ensure high
	reliability and dependability.</p><p>This release is aimed

This section
      focuses on those ways that are primarily useful for obtaining a
      complete FreeBSD distribution, rather than updating an existing
      installation.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45005304"></a>2.1. CDROM and DVD</h3></div></div></div><p>FreeBSD -RELEASE distributions may be ordered on CDROM or DVD
	from several publishers.  This is frequently the most
	convenient way to obtain FreeBSD for new installations, as it
	provides a convenient way to quickly reinstall the system if
	necessary.  Some distributions include some of the optional,
	precompiled <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">packages</span>&#8221;</span> from the FreeBSD Ports
	Collection, or other extra material.</p><p>A list of the CDROM and DVD publishers known to the

	optional packages from <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/" target="_top">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/</a></code>,
	which is the official FreeBSD release site, or any of its

	<a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html" target="_top">FTP
	Sites</a> section of the Handbook.
	Finding a close (in networking terms) mirror from which to
	download the distribution is highly recommended.</p><p>Additional mirror sites are always welcome.  Contact
	<code class="email">&lt;<a xmlns="" class="email" href="mailto:freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;</code> for more details on

	article.</p><p>Mirrors generally contain the ISO images generally used to
	create a CDROM of a FreeBSD release.  They usually also contain
	floppy disk images (for applicable platforms), as well as the
	files necessary to do an installation over the network.
	Finally mirrors sites usually contain a set of packages for
	the most current release.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="contacting"></a>3. Contacting the FreeBSD Project</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45044088"></a>3.1. Email and Mailing Lists</h3></div></div></div><p>For any questions or general technical support issues,

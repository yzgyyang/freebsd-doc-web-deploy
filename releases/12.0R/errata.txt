   This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD
   12.0-CURRENT Before installing this version, it is important to consult
   this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that
   may already have been found and fixed.

   Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release

   are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which
   keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

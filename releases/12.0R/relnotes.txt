   Abstract

   The release notes for FreeBSD 12.0-CURRENT contain a summary of the
   changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the 12-CURRENT development
   line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were issued
   since the last release, as well as significant changes to the FreeBSD
   kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also presented.

1. Introduction

   This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 12.0-CURRENT. It
   describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It also
   provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

   The snapshot distribution to which these release notes apply represents
   the latest point along the 12-CURRENT development branch since 12-CURRENT
   was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary snapshot
   distributions along this branch can be found at
   https://www.FreeBSD.org/snapshots/.

   The snapshot distribution to which these release notes apply represents a
   point along the 12-CURRENT development branch between 11.0-RELEASE and the
   future 12.0-RELEASE. Information regarding pre-built, binary snapshot
   distributions along this branch can be found at
   https://www.FreeBSD.org/snapshots/.

   This distribution of FreeBSD 12.0-CURRENT is a snapshot distribution. It
   can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/snapshots/ or any of its mirrors.
   More information on obtaining this (or other) snapshot distributions of
   FreeBSD can be found in the "Obtaining FreeBSD" appendix to the FreeBSD
   Handbook.

   All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
   FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
   discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
   contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
   to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
   12.0-CURRENT can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

   This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
   FreeBSD since 11.0-RELEASE. In general, changes described here are unique
   to the 12-CURRENT branch unless specifically marked as MERGED features.

   Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
   after 11.0-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
   options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may also
   list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering practices.
   Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change made to FreeBSD
   between releases; this document focuses primarily on security advisories,
   user-visible changes, and major architectural improvements.

2. Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

   Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various
   security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8) utility. The
   binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities, as
   well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an official
   FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires that the host
   being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

   Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system
   from source code) from previous versions are supported, according to the
   instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

  Important:

   Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up all data and
   configuration files.

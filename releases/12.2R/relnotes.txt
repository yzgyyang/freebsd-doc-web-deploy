1. Introduction

   This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 12.2-RELEASE. It
   describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It also
   provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

   The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents the
   latest point along the 12-STABLE development branch since 12-STABLE was
   created. Information regarding pre-built, binary release distributions
   along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

   The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents a
   point along the 12-STABLE development branch between 12.1-RELEASE and the
   future 12.3-RELEASE. Information regarding pre-built, binary release
   distributions along this branch can be found at
   https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

   This distribution of FreeBSD 12.2-RELEASE is a release distribution. It
   can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors.
   More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of
   FreeBSD can be found in the "Obtaining FreeBSD" appendix to the FreeBSD
   Handbook.

   All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
   FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
   discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
   contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
   to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
   12.2-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

   This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
   FreeBSD since 12.1-RELEASE. In general, changes described here are unique
   to the 12-STABLE branch unless specifically marked as MERGED features.

   Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
   after 12.1-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
   options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may also
   list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering practices.
   Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change made to FreeBSD
   between releases; this document focuses primarily on security advisories,
   user-visible changes, and major architectural improvements.

2. Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

   [amd64,i386] Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of
   the various security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8)
   utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland
   utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of
   an official FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires that
   the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

   Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system
   from source code) from previous versions are supported, according to the
   instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

  Important:

   Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up all data and
   configuration files.

3. Security and Errata

10. Ports Collection and Package Infrastructure

   This section covers changes to the FreeBSD Ports Collection, package
   infrastructure, and package maintenance and installation tools.

  10.1. Packaging Changes

   The pkg(8) utility has been updated to version 1.15.10.

11. General Notes Regarding Future FreeBSD Releases

  11.1. Default CPUTYPE Change

   Starting with FreeBSD-13.0, the default CPUTYPE for the i386 architecture
   will change from 486 to 686.

   This means that, by default, binaries produced will require a 686-class
   CPU, including but not limited to binaries provided by the FreeBSD Release
   Engineering team. FreeBSD 13.0 will continue to support older CPUs,
   however users needing this functionality will need to build their own
   releases for official support.

   As the primary use for i486 and i586 CPUs is generally in the embedded
   market, the general end-user impact is expected to be minimal, as new
   hardware with these CPU types has long faded, and much of the deployed
   base of such systems is nearing retirement age, statistically.

   There were several factors taken into account for this change. For
   example, i486 does not have 64-bit atomics, and while they can be emulated
   in the kernel, they cannot be emulated in the userland. Additionally, the
   32-bit amd64 libraries have been i686 since their inception.

   As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers using the lib32
   libraries on 64-bit hardware with the COMPAT_FREEBSD32 option in the
   kernel, this change ensures better coverage and user experience. This also
   aligns with what the majority of Linux(R) distributions have been doing
   for quite some time.

   This is expected to be the final bump of the default CPUTYPE in i386.

  Important:

   This change does not affect the FreeBSD 12.x or 11.x series of releases.

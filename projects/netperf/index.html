    <h2>Project Goal</h2>

    <p>The netperf project is working to enhance the performance of the
      FreeBSD network stack.  This work grew out of the
      SMPng Project, which moved the FreeBSD kernel from
      a "Giant Lock" to more fine-grained locking and multi-threading.  SMPng
      offered both performance improvement and degradation for the network
      stack, improving parallelism and preemption, but substantially
      increasing per-packet processing costs.  The netperf project is
      primarily focussed on further improving parallelism in network
      processing while reducing the SMP synchronization overhead.  This in
      turn will lead to higher processing throughput and lower processing
      latency.</p>

    <a name="strategies" shape="rect" id="strategies"></a>
    <h2>Project Strategies</h2>
    <p>Robert Watson</p>

    <p>The two primary focuses of this work are to increase parallelism
      while decreasing overhead.  Several activities are being performed that
      will work toward these goals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The Netperf project has completed locking work for all components
	of the network stack; as of FreeBSD 7.0 we have removed non-MPSAFE
	protocol shims, and as of FreeBSD 8.0 we have removed non-MPSAFE
	device driver shims.</p></li>

      <li><p>Optimize locking strategies to find better balances between
	locking granularity and locking overhead.  In the first cut at locking
	for the kernel, the goal was to adopt a medium-grained locking
	approach based on data locking.  This approach identifies critical
	data structures, and inserts new locks and locking operations to
	protect those data structures.  Depending on the data model of the
	code being protected, this may lead to the introduction of a
	substantial number of locks offering unnecessary granularity, where
	the overhead of locking overwhelms the benefits of available
	parallelism and preemption.  By selectively reducing granularity, it
	is possible to improve performance by decreasing locking overhead.
	</p></li>

      <li><p>Amortize the cost of locking by processing queues of packets or
	events.  While the cost of individual synchronization operations may
	be high, it is possible to amortize the cost of synchronization
	operations by grouping processing of similar data (packets, events)
	under the same protection.  This approach focuses on identifying
	places where similar locking occurs frequently in succession, and
	introducing queueing or coalescing of lock operations across the
	body of the work.  For example, when a series of packets is inserted
	into an outgoing interface queue, a basic locking approach would
	lock the queue for each insert operation, unlock it, and hand off to
	the interface driver to begin the send, repeating this sequence as
	required.  With a coalesced approach, the caller would pass off a
	queue of packets in order to reduce the locking overhead, as well as
	eliminate unnecessary synchronization due to the queue being
	thread-local.  This approach can be applied at several levels in the
	stack, and is particularly applicable at lower levels of the stack
	where streams of packets require almost identical processing.
	</p></li>

      <li><p>Introduce new synchronization strategies with reduced overhead
	relative to traditional strategies.  Most traditional strategies
	employ a combination of interrupt disabling and atomic operations to
	achieve mutual exclusion and non-preemption guarantees.  However,
	these operations are expensive on modern CPUs, leading to the desire
	for cheaper primitives with weaker semantics.  For example, the
	application of uni-processor primitives where synchronization is
	required only on a single processor, and optimizations to critical
	section primitives to avoid the need for interrupt disabling.
	</p></li>

      <li><p>Modify synchronization strategies to take advantage of
	additional, non-locking, synchronization primitives.  This approach
	might take the form of making increased use of per-CPU or per-thread
	data structures, which require little or no synchronization.  For
	example, through the use of critical sections, it is possible to
	synchronize access to per-CPU caches and queues.  Through the use of
	per-thread queues, data can be handed off between stack layers
	without the use of synchronization.</p></li>

      <li><p>Increase the opportunities for parallelism through increased
	threading in the network stack.  The current network stack model
	offers the opportunity for substantial parallelism, with outbound
	processing typically taking place in the context of the sending
	thread in kernel, crypto occurring in crypto worker threads, and
	receive processing taking place in a combination of the receiving
	ithread and dispatched netisr thread.  While handoffs between
	threads introduces overhead (synchronization, context switching),
	there is the opportunity to increase parallelism in some workloads
	through introducing additional worker threads.  Identifying work
	that may be relocated to new threads must be done carefully to
	balance overhead, and latency concerns, but can pay off by
	increasing effective CPU utilization and hence throughput.  For
	example, introducing additional netisr threads capable of running on
	more than one CPU at a time can increase input parallelism, subject
	to maintaining desirable packet ordering (present in FreeBSD
	8.0).</p></li>

	  undesired garbage collection.  For socket system calls, overhead
	  can be reduced by relying on the file descriptor reference count,
	  thus avoiding the synchronized operations necessary to modify the
	  socket reference count, an approach also taken in the VFS code.

    <h2>Netperf Cluster</h2>

    <p>Through the generous donations and investment of Sentex Data
      Communications, FreeBSD Systems, IronPort Systems, and the FreeBSD
      Foundation, a network performance testbed has been created in Ontario,
      Canada for use by FreeBSD developers working in the area of network
      performance.  A similar cluster, made possible through the generous
      donation of Verio, is being prepared for use in more general SMP
      performance work in Virginia, US.  Each cluster consists of several SMP
      systems inter-connected with giga-bit ethernet such that relatively
      arbitrary topologies can be constructed in order to test host-host, IP
      forwarding, and bridging performance scenarios.  Systems are network
      booted, have serial console, and remote power, in order to maximize
      availability and minimize configuration overhead.  These systems are
      available on a check-out basis for experimentation and performance
      measurement to FreeBSD developers working on the Netperf project, and
      in related areas.</p>

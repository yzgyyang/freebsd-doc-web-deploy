      BinarySEC is an intelligent web application firewall.  It runs on

      Its artificial intelligence engine learns normal traffic received on a
      website or any web application (provided it uses Apache) and is then
      able to stop suspicious HTTP requests.  It has two modes: alert
      (suspicious traffic is just reported, not stopped) and blocking mode.
      The webmaster (or the admin) has the ability to make the AI engine learn
      normal traffic so that the profiles of these requests generate no more
      false positives.  After a few days, no more false alerts will appear,
      only suspicious traffic will have been blocked.  BinarySEC is a relevant
      tool to harden a web application.<br clear="none" />

      co-organized by all local communities in Taiwan, we hope to enlarge the
      participation of local communities during such kind of cooperation. Just
      like the spirit of COSCUP, in this conference, you can be both attendee
      and promoter, and also involve the operation of the conference.

      The major topics in COSCUP 2007 including web-based platform and embedded
      system due to the popularity of Web 2.0 and OLPC; the Chinese session,
      Lightning Talk and System session are the most interesting topics for
      years.  There will be some presentations and talks about FreeBSD.

      The program is attractive just like before, we invite not only big ones
      in the community but also developers of non-famous local OSS projects,
      to get more people involved and make OSS more brilliant in Taiwan.

LOCATION:UC Extension San Francisco: Room 216, South of Market Center, San Francisco, USA

DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20071003
DESCRIPTION:The BSD community started at UC Berkeley in the late
      1970's. Through the 1980's, the BSD software was developed and
      released from Berkeley. In 1992, Berkeley made its final
      release, 4.4BSD-Lite, an open-source version of BSD. Since that
      time, independent development has continued by the FreeBSD,
      NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, and Dragonfly projects. This talk
      traces the history and structure of the BSD community from its
      start as a small group of paid staff at Berkeley up through the
      thousands of volunteer developers that make up the FreeBSD
      Project of today. It describes how the development structure set
      up at Berkeley was expanded to create a self-organizing project
      that supports an ever growing and changing group of developers
      around the world.

DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20070929
DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20071103
DESCRIPTION:This course will provide a firm background in the
      FreeBSD kernel. The course will cover basic kernel services,
      process structure, the FreeBSD jail facility for hosting virtual
      machines, scheduling, signal handling, and virtual and physical
      memory management. The kernel I/O structure will be described
      showing how I/O is multiplexed, special devices are handled,
      character processing is performed, and the buffer pool is
      managed. The implementation of the filesystem and its
      capabilities, including soft updates and snapshots, will be
      described. The filesystem interface will then be described to
      show how it can be used to support multiple filesystem types
      such as Sun Microsystem's Network File System (NFS). The course
      will also cover the FreeBSD socket-based network architecture,
      layering, and implementation. Socket communications primitives
      and internal layering will be discussed, with emphasis on the
      interfaces between layers; the TCP/IP implementation will be
      used as an example. A discussion of routing issues will be
      included. Other system-related topics include performance
      measurement, system tuning, and security issues. The
      presentations will emphasize code organization, data structure
      navigation, and algorithms. It will not cover machine-specific
      parts of the system, such as device drivers.

      Saturdays September 29, October 6 and 27, and

      historical narrative. The BSD community began at the UC Berkeley
      in the late 1970s. You'll hear about the triumphs and defeats of
      the project and its releases during its heyday in the 1980s. The
      Berkeley era concludes with the tumultuous lawsuit, ultimately
      settled in Berkeley's favor, which allowed the final release in
      1992 of 4.4BSD-Lite, an open-source version of BSD. The talk
      includes a brief commentary on the FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
      Darwin, and Dragonfly projects that took their genesis from the

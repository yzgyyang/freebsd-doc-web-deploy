      <title>BSDCan-2012 - Michael Dexter - An applied survey of BSD multiplicity
	      and virtualization strategies from chroot to BHyVe</title>
      <guid>http://www.bsdcan.org/2012/schedule/events/291.en.html</guid>

      <description>
		Ever since the University of California, Berkeley CSRG
		implemented the chroot(8) command and system call in its
		BSD operating system in 1982, the community-developed
		BSD Unix derivatives have set the standard for
		the introduction of plurality to the conventionally-singular
		Unix computing model. Today's system operators and developers
		have an array of BSD-licensed multiplicity strategies at their
		disposal that offer various degrees of both isolation and
		virtualization when introducing plurality. This paper will
		survey current and experimental BSD multiplicity strategies
		including chroot, FreeBSD jail, NetBSD/Xen, Amazon EC2,
		compatlinux, GXemul and SIMH, plus experimental strategies
		such as FreeBSD BHyVe, compatmach, Usermode NetBSD,
		Dragonfly BSD vkernel, OpenBSD sysjail and NetBSD mult.
		As an applied survey, this paper will both categorize each
		multiplicity strategy by the Unix environment to which
		it introduces plurality and demonstrate the usage
		of the utilities relating to each solution.

      <title>BSDCan-2012 - Kirk McKusick - An Overview of Locking in the FreeBSD
	      Kernel</title>
      <guid>http://www.bsdcan.org/2012/schedule/events/306.en.html</guid>
      <pubdate>2012-05-30</pubdate>
      <enclosure url="http://www.bsdcan.org/2012/schedule/attachments/195_locking.pdf" length="1" type="application/octet-stream"/>
      <description>
		The FreeBSD kernel uses seven different types of locks
		to ensure proper access to the resources that it manages.
		This talk describes the hierarchy of these locks from
		the low-level and simple to the high-level and full-featured.

		The functionality of each type of lock is described along
		with the problem domain for which it is intended.
		The talk concludes by describing the witness system
		within the FreeBSD kernel that tracks the usage of all
		the locks in the system and reports any possible deadlocks
		that might occur because of improper acquisition ordering
		of locks.

      <description>
		Security Event Audit is a facility to provide fine-grained,
		configurable logging of security-relevant events.
		Audit events are stored in trail files that can be used
		for postmortem analysis in case of system compromise.
		Once the system is compromised, an attacker has access
		to audit trail files and can modify or delete them.
		The auditdistd daemon's role is to distribute audit
		trail files to a remote system in a secure and reliable way.

      <description>
		Bullet Cache is an in-memory cache server inspired by
		memcached, but with a twist: a powerful record tagging
		and bulk query facility, configurable multithreading
		models and a dump / cache prewarm option. This talk
		will have two parts: a technical description of
		Bullet Cache's implementation with focus on programming
		techniques and optimizations, and a description of usage
		scenarios with the focus on how it can help real-world
		applications (not limited to Web applications).

      <description>
		The Zetabyte File System (ZFS) is a modern file system
		which combines traditional file system features like a
		POSIX file system interface with RAID and volume management
		functionality. Features such as snapshot management and	file
		share management are all managed within the ZFS interface.

		This management interface provides a number of
		opportunities to simplify system management. In the
		Technical Computing Services Sub-division of The
		Aerospace Corporation we are taking advantage of these
		features in a number of different ways. This talk
		presents some of the more interesting ones.

      <title>BSDCan-2010 - Kris Moore - The PBI format re-implemented for
	      FreeBSD and PC-BSD</title>

      <description>
		The PBI format (Push Button Installer) has been the default
		package management system for PC-BSD going on 5+ years now.
		However as we looked to the future it became apparent that it
		was greatly needing an overhaul to both improve its
		functionality, and expand its usage outside the scope of
		just PC-BSD. Among the areas needing improvement were how
		it dealt with identical libraries between applications,
		the heavy requirements from being implemented in QT/KDE,
		and lack of a digital verification mechanism.

		Setting up a central syslog server.
		
		
		If you are concerned about the security of your logs, use a dedicated machine and lock it down.
		Keep clocks in sync.
		You may need to change log rotation schedule in /etc/newsyslog.conf. You can rotate based in size and/or time. This can be as much a policy decision as a hardware decision.
		On central log host, change syslogd flags to listen to network. Each BSD does this differently, so check the man pages. Also, check out the -n flag for busy environments.
		Make sure host firewall allows syslog traffic through.
		Be careful to limit syslog traffic to just the trusted network or hosts. FreeBSD man page refers to syslogd as a "remote disk filling service".
		For heavy logging environments, it is important to have a dedicated network. A down syslogd server can create a lot of "ARP who-has" broadcasts.
		Most network devices such as printers and commercial firewalls support sending to a central syslog server. Take a look at "Snare" for Windows hosts.
		To send messages from a Unix host, specify the host name prepended with @ instead of a file for logging in /etc/syslog.conf. For example, change /var/log/xferlog to @loghost.mydomain.biz. You can also copy and edit the line to have it log to both a local file and a remote host.

      <description>
		
		Why I like the CLI:
		
		
		Uses minimal resources. Less space, less memory, fewer dependencies.
		Transparency. GUI hides internals, limits options.
		Similar between Unix-like systems. GUI tools seem to change every week.
		Remote management. SSH rocks.
		Everything is text. Configs, devices, output. CLI is natural complement.
		Pipes and scripts. One time is hard, a thousand times is easy.
		Only need a few tools. Grep, sed, awk, vi, cron.
		Text config files. Easy to version, share, and comment.
		Requires reading skills instead of clicking skills.
		Much faster when you know what you are doing.

		 Important when you don't trust the computer you are using, such as a library computer or internet kiosk.
		 Available by default in Free/Net/Open BSD.
		 FreeBSD uses OPIE, Net/Open use S/Key.
		 One time passwords are based on your pass phrase, a non-repeating sequence number, and a seed.
		 Initial setup should be done directly on the server.
		 "skeyinit" for Net/Open, "opiepasswd -c" for FreeBSD.
		 Enter a pass phrase that is not your regular account password.
		 Find your current sequence number and seed with "opieinfo" or "skeyinfo", for example: "497 pc5246".
		 Generate a list of the next 10 passwords and write them down, using "opiekey -n 10 497 pc5246" or "skey -n 10 497 pc5246".
		 When you log in from a remote machine that might have a keystroke logger, you can now use a one time password instead of your regular password.
		 For OpenBSD, log in as account:skey, for example "bob:skey", which will cause the system to present the s/key challenge.
		 For NetBSD, the system will always present you with the s/key challenge if it is configured for your account, although you can still use your regular password.
		 FreeBSD by default will force you to use a one time password if it is configured for your account.
		 If you want both OPIE and password authentication, FreeBSD allows you to list trusted networks or hosts in /etc/opieaccess.
		 Instead of carrying a list of passwords around, you can use s/key generators on a portable device that you trust, such as a palm pilot.
		 For more info, check the man pages.

		A sneak peak into the FreeBSD development process.
		
		Warning 2 hours! filmed over 2 days.
		(The schedule worked out was optimistic to say the
		least but it's still looking ok...)
		
		Marko Zec and Julian Elischer report back to the
		developers at BSDCan on the progress on virtualizing
		the network stack in FreeBSD. This has been a long
		term project but at the time of this recording was
		just reaching the point of feasibility. In this
		video you can see some of the dynamics of the group
		as developers become familiar with the project and
		discussions take place regarding such things as
		maintainability, ABI compatibility, and even what
		to call the feature. In this video you can see the
		decision being made by a "quorum" of developers to
		take this project mainstream.
		
		The sound is less that perfect, but it's what we have.
		
		This is a montage of 3 video sources, one of which
		is a lower resolution, but at times it was the only
		camera capturing the action. (the other ran out of
		tape for a while)
		
		Thanks to Ed Maste for the added footage.
		
		I will be doing more editing later and will be
		substituting in better footage in some places.

		The talk will introduce packet filter (pf) - a *BSD
		firewall system - and summarize its history and
		projected future. After providing a short overview
		of pf's general functionality and some firewall
		basics, it will concentrate on packet filter's
		advanced feature-set from the administrator's point
		of view. The talk will also cover the integration
		of ALTQ, a mature framework for traffic shaping and
		priorization. Finally it will provide a short
		overview of the "Common Address Redundancy Protocol"
		(CARP) and its integration in pf.

		UNIX is the best operating system ever designed so
		everybody is running UNIX on their computer, right
		? This presentation takes a partisan looks a why
		UNIX never became a big success in the eighties,
		failed to win the market in the nineties, and still
		struggles in the market in the new millennium.
		Poul-Henning will take a critical look at the
		mistakes of the past and the mistakes of the present
		and try to make it really clear what needs to happen
		for UNIX to become a real success.

		This paper provides a how-to embed FreeBSD. A console
		server built form an AT91RM9200 based ARM system
		will be explored. This paper will talk about the
		selection of hardware. It will explore creating
		images for the target system, as well as concentrate
		on different alternatives for deploying the system.
		A number of different options exist today, and no
		comprehensive guide for navigating through the
		choices exists today. This paper will explore the
		different alternatives that exist today for producing
		images targeted at different size requirements. The
		differing choices for storage in an embedded
		environment are explored. The techniques used to
		access rich debugging environments are discussed.

		In the past ten years most of the research in network
		protocols has gone into TCP, leaving UDP to languish
		as a local configuration protocol. While the majority
		of Internet traffic is TCP, UDP remains the only
		IP protocol that works over multicast and as such
		has some specific, and interesting uses in some
		areas of computing. In 2008 we undertook a study
		of the performance of UDP multicast on both 1Gbps
		and 10Gbps Ethernet networks in order to see if
		changing the physical layer of the network would
		give a linear decrease in packet latency. To measure
		the possible gains we developed a new network
		protocol test program, mctest, which is capable of
		recording packet round trip times from many hosts
		simultaneously and which we believe accurately
		represents how many environments use multicast. The
		mctest program has been integrated into FreeBSD and
		is now being used to verify the proper operation
		of multicast on various pieces of 10Gbps hardware.

		In recent years, traditional branches of engineering
		like Civil, Chemical, Mechanical, Electrical and
		Industrial Engineering are requiring extensive
		computing facilities for their needs. Several well
		known labs (Sandia, Lawrence Livermore) rely on
		huge clusters to do all types of complex analysis
		that were unthinkable a couple of decades ago. While
		the free BSD variants share the environment with
		traditional UNIX systems, frequently used for such
		computations, it was not common to find adequate
		free software packages to carry complex calculations.
		Eventually commercial versions of important math
		related packages started to appear for the Linux
		platform. Even when the big packages were distant,
		the BSDs learned and adapted in resourceful ways:
		Matlab and Mathematica, running under Linux emulation,
		demanded functionality from the BSDs and NetBSD
		implemented a signal trampoline to be able to run
		AutoCAD with IRIX binary compatibility. A notable
		project that was always available under a free
		license was Berkeley's Spice circuit analysis
		program, however it was an exception rather than
		the rule. Even when the scientific community pressed
		for a while to get other important tools like NASA's
		FEA package Nastran under a free license, the
		objective of being able to access and enhance open
		scientific tools was elusive. About a decade ago
		the situation started to improve: FreeBSD's ports
		system started growing exponentially, first with a
		high content in the math category, afterwards with
		a CAD section and after sustained growth in those
		categories a science section was created. This
		growth was mostly pushed by Universities and their
		research projects and in general are not well known
		with respect to the commercial counterparts. I
		started porting math/engineering code for FreeBSD
		around 1996. Back then it was absolutely unthinkable
		for a Mechanical Engineer to depend only on FreeBSD
		for it's daily work. The situation nowadays is
		different: there are some very high quality engineering
		analysis packages like EDF's Code Aster, with more
		than 12 years of professional development, that
		just can't be ignored. A Finite Element package,
		like Code Aster, can easily cost 5000 US$, is priced
		according to the maximum problem size it can solve,
		can require yearly licenses, and is rarely available
		with source code. In NASTRAN's case the source code
		is only available for US citizens under a yearly
		fee. Free software does have serious limitations
		though; just like in office applications there are
		proprietary CAD formats or sometimes the package
		simply doesn't have the required functionality.
		Having the sources, of course, always has the
		advantage of being able to implement (or pay for)
		some specific functionality you might need. Many
		commercial packages have been recently ported to
		Linux, but even when they gain some of the advantages
		of an open environment they still have yet another
		limitation: they have been very slow to make use
		of the multicored features of the new processors
		in the market, a huge limitation now that the speed
		war between processors has been limited by the
		overheating problem. The objective of the talk is
		to give an overview of several CAD/CAE packages
		that have been made available recently as part of
		FreeBSD's ports system and the decisions that were
		made to port them. BRLCAD and Varkon are two CAD
		utilities that made a transition from closed source
		to an open environment and in the process in the
		process of getting ported to BSD have gained greater
		portability and general "bug" fixes critical for
		their consolidation as usable and maintainable
		projects. There are also some tricks that have not
		been well documented: it is possible to enable
		threads and some extra optimizations on some packages,
		and it is also possible to replace the standard
		BLAS library with the faster GOTO BLAS without
		rebuilding the package. It is also possible to build
		the packages optimized for a clustered environment,
		but perhaps what is most interesting of all is how
		all the packages interrelate with each other and
		can turn FreeBSD into a complete enginering
		environment. No OS distribution so far is offering
		all the engineering specific utilities offered
		through FreeBSD's ports system: from design to
		visualization, passing through analysis FreeBSD is
		becoming an option that can't be ignored, and best
		of all, it is an effort that will benefit not only
		FreeBSD but the wider audience.
		
		Pedro F. Giffuni M. Sc. Industrial Engineering -
		University of Pittsburgh Mechanical Engineer -
		Universidad Nacional de Colombia I was born in
		Bogota, Colombia but I am an Italian citizen. My
		experience with computers started when I was about
		12 years old With the TRS-80 Color Computer first
		using Basic and the OS-9. I studied electronics for
		3 years but became tired of worrying about "whatever
		happened to electrons in there" and moved to
		Mechanical Engineering. For a while I rested from
		the computer world until the Internet came stepping
		along. I started using FreeBSD around 1995 and soon
		fell in love with the idea of being able to install
		a complete version of UNIX from the net with just
		one floppy. After submitting a the 999th port to
		the FreeBSD project Walnut Creek was kind enough
		to give me a subscription for several years to
		FreeBSD's CD-ROM. Since then I've been on and off
		porting software packages or fixing the bugs I have
		caused while porting them. Of course there has
		always been great respect for the other BSDs and
		their wonderful license and while I've given up on
		the idea of one day seeing a "UnifiedBSD" I am glad
		to see different approaches sharing ideas in a
		healthful environment.

		In this talk, we will discuss the past and present
		history and the design principles of the OpenBSD
		hardware sensors framework. Sensors framework
		provides a unified interface for storing, registering
		and accessing information about hardware monitoring
		sensors. Sensor types include, but are not limited
		to, temperature, voltage, fan RPM, time offset and
		logical drive status. The framework spans
		sensor_attach(9), sysctl(3), sysctl(8), sensorsd(8),
		ntpd(8), snmpd(8) and more than 67 drivers, ranging
		from I2C temperature sensors and Super I/O hardware
		monitors to IPMI, RAID and SCSI enclosures. Several
		third-party tools are also available, for example,
		a plug-in for Nagios and ports/sysutils/symon.
		Originally based on some ideas from NetBSD, the
		framework has sustained many improvements in OpenBSD,
		and was ported and committed to FreeBSD and DragonFly
		BSD.
		
		Constantine A. Murenin is an MMath graduate student
		at the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science
		at the University of Waterloo (CA). Prior to his
		graduate appointment, Constantine attended and
		subsequently graduated from East Carolina University
		(US) and De Montfort University (UK), receiving two
		bachelor degrees in computer science, with honors
		and honours respectively. A FreeBSD Google Summer
		of Code 2007 Student, OpenBSD Committer and Mozilla
		Contributor, Constantine's interests range from
		standards compliance and usability at all levels,
		to quiet computing and hardware monitoring.

		including more detailed informations on changes
		which have a significant impact on administrator's
		bad habits (why the common way of doing it is bad,
		why it was sometimes needed in the past, how to do
		it the good way now, why this is far better), on
		both the UserLand (ipsec-tools project) and maybe
		in [Free|Net]BSD kernels/ IPSec stacks.
		
		The second part will talk about the future of the
		project. News of the next major version (which may
		be out or about to be out when we'll be ate
		EuroBSDCon), news works which are planned or which
		are done but not yet public, but also news about
		the team: it's new members, new tools, what we would
		like to do in tue future, a

		The arrival of high CPU core density, with commodity
		quad-core notebooks and 32-core servers, combined
		with 10gbps networking have transformed network
		design principles for operating systems. This talk
		will describe changes in the FreeBSD 6.x, 7.x, and
		forthcoming 8.x network stacks required to exploit
		multiple cores and serve 10gbps networks. The goal
		of the session will be to introduce the audience
		to general strategies used to improve performance,
		their rationales, and their impact on applications
		and users:
		
		Introduction to the SMPng Project and the follow-on Netperf Project
		Workloads and performance measurement
		Efficient primitives to support modern network stacks
		Multi-core and cache-aware network memory allocator
		Fine-grained network stack locking
		Load-balancing and contention-avoidance across multiple CPUs
		CPU affinity for network stack data structures
		TCP performance enhancements including TSO, LRO, and TOE
		Zero-copy Berkely Packet Filter (BPF) buffers
		Direct network stack dispatch from interrupt handlers
		Multiple input and output queues
		
		
		Robert Watson is a researcher at the University of
		Cambridge Computer Laboratory investinging operating
		system and network security. Prior to joining the
		Computer Laboratory to work on a PhD, he was Senior
		Principal Scientist at McAfee Research, now SPARTA
		ISSO, a leading security research and development
		organization, directing government and commercial
		research contracts for customers that include DARPA,
		the US Navy, and Apple Computer. His research
		interests include operating system security, network
		stack structure and performance, and windowing
		system structure. He is also a member of the FreeBSD
		Core Team and president of the FreeBSD Foundation.

	    Martin Schuette has three main goals, defined by three
	    internet drafts to implement:
	    
	    TLS transport is the most obvious improvement: it
	    provides a reliable network transport with data encryption
	    and peer authentication. To make full use of this a
	    buffering mechanism to bridge temporary network errors
	    is implemented as well.
	    Syslog-protocol extends the message format to use
	    a complete timestamp, include a fully qualified domain
	    name, and allow UTF-8 messages. It also offers a
	    structured data field to unambiguously encode application
	    dependent information.
	    Syslog-sign will allow any syslog sender to digitally
	    sign its messages, so their integrity can be verified
	    later. This enable the detection of loss, deletion or
	    other manipulation syslog data after network transfer
	    or archiving on storage media.
	    
	    
	    Martin Schuette is a student of computer science in
	    Potsdam, Germany, and has been working as a part-time
	    system administrator for BSD servers since 2004.
	    
	    In 2007 Martin Schuette already gave a talk on Syslog
	    at the Chemnitze Linux-Tage
	    (http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2007/vortraege/detail.html?idx=547
	    in german; for a newer english version see these slides

		Given the modern trend towards multi-core shared
		memory multiprocessors, it is inconceivable for
		production OS kernels not to be reentrant. The
		typical approach for allowing multiple execution
		contexts to simultaneously execute in kernel mode
		has been to use fine-grained locking for synchronising
		access to shared resources. While this technique
		has been proven efficient, empirical evidence
		suggests that the resulting locking rules tend to
		be cumbersome even for the experienced kernel
		programmer, leading to bugs that are hard to diagnose.
		Moreover, scaling to more processors requires
		extensive use of locks, which may impose unnecessary
		locking overhead for small scale multiprocessor
		systems. This talk will describe the typical approach
		and then discuss the alternative approach taken in
		the DragonFlyBSD network stack. We will give an
		overview of the various protocol threads employed
		for network I/O processing and the common-case code
		paths for packet reception and transmission.
		Additionally, we'll need to make a passing reference
		to DragonFlyBSD's message passing model. This should
		establish a baseline, allowing us to focus on the
		recent work by the author to eliminate use of the
		Big Giant Lock in the performance-critical paths
		for the TCP and UDP protocols. The decision to
		constrain this work on the two by far most widely-used
		transport protocols was made in order to (a) limit
		the amount of work necessary and (b) explore the
		effectiveness of the approach on the cases that
		matter at this point in time.

		Edd Barrett will speak about using the BSD Platform
		as a means of typesetting from a practical standpoint
		at EuroBSDcon 2008. Edd Barrett does not wish to
		go into the technicalities of each typesetter, but
		rather state which are good for certain types of
		document, and which tools (ports and packages),
		integrate well with the available typesetters.

		Many BSD-licensed strategies of various levels of
		maturity exist to implement multiplicity, herein
		defined as the introduction of plurality to
		traditionally singular computing environments via
		isolation, virtualization, or other method. For
		example, the chroot utility introduces an additional
		isolated root execution environment within that of
		the host; or an emulator provides highly-isolated
		virtual systems that can run complete native or
		foreign operating systems. Motivations for multiplicity
		vary, but a demonstrable desire exists for users
		to obtain root or run a foreign binary or operating
		system. We propose a hands-on survey of portable
		and integrated BSD-licensed multiplicity strategies
		applicable to the FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD
		and NetBSD operating systems on the i386 architecture.
		We will also address three oft-coupled disciplines:
		software storage devices, the installation of
		operating system and userlands in multiplicity
		environments plus the management of select multiplicity
		environments. Finally we will comment on each
		strategies potential limits of isolation, compatibility,
		independence and potential overhead in comparison
		to traditional systems. Keywords: multiplicity,
		virtualization, chroot, jail, hypervisor, xen,
		compat.
		
		Michael Dexter has used Unix systems since 1991 and
		BSD-licensed multiplicity strategies for over five
		years. He is the Program Manager at the BSD Fund
		and Project Manager of the BSD.lv Project.

		Hello My name is Nick Barkas. I'm a master's student
		studying scientific computing at Kungliga Tekniska
		hgskolan (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. I have just
		begun work on a Google Summer of Code project with
		FreeBSD: Dynamic memory allocation for dirhash in
		UFS2  . I would like to present my results from
		this project at EuroBSDCon this year. This project
		is very much a work in progress now so it is a bit
		difficult to summarize what I would ultimately
		present. I will try to describe an outline, though.
		First I will give background information on dirhash:
		an explanation of the directory data structure in
		UFS2, how directory lookups in this structure
		necessitate a linear search, and how dirhash speeds
		these lookups up without having to change anything
		about the directory data structure. Next I will
		explain the current limitation that dirhash's maximum
		memory use must be manually specified by administrators,
		or left at a small conservative default of 2MB. I
		will explain some different methods I will have
		explored to try and make this maximum memory limit
		dynamically increase and decrease as the system has
		more or less free memory, and which method I will
		have ultimately settled on and implemented. Then
		I'll present some test results of performance of
		operations on very large directories with and without
		dynamic memory allocation enabled for dirhash. Next
		I will talk about how speed gains from dirhash are
		limited by the fact that the hash tables exist only
		in memory and must be recreated after each system
		boot, as big directories are scanned for the first
		time, or even have to be recreated for a directory
		that has not been scanned in some time if its dirhash
		has been discarded to free memory. These problems
		can be eliminated by using an on-disk index for
		directory entries. I will talk about some of the
		challenges of implementing on-disk indexing, such
		as remaining backwards compatible with older versions
		of UFS2 and interoperating properly with softupdates.
		Then, if my SoC project has permitted me time to
		work on this aspect of it, I will explain some
		possible methods for adding directory indexing to
		UFS2 that meets these challenges, and which of those
		ideas I will have implemented. Finally I will present
		results of some benchmarks on this filesystem with
		indices, and compare to performance with dirhash,
		and with no indices or dirhashes.
		
		Keywords: dirhash, ufs2, filesystems, performance tuning

		Traditional project management methodologies are
		typically based on the waterfall model where there
		are distinct phases: requirements capture, design,
		implementation, testing, delivery. Once a project
		has moved on to the next phase there is no going
		back. The end result is often a late project that
		no-one wants anymore because the requirements have
		fundamentally changed by the time the project is
		delivered.

		The members of the BSD family have traditionally
		prospered off the desktop, as operating systems on
		servers and embedded systems. The advent of MacOS
		X has marked a change, and moved the desktop more
		into focus. Modern desktop systems create a richer
		software landscape, with more diverse requirements,
		than their server counterparts. User demands,
		software package interdependencies and frequent
		security issues result in a change rate that can
		put a considerable load on the admin staff. Without
		central management tools, previously identical
		installations diverge quickly. This paper looks at
		concepts and strategies for managing tens to hundreds
		of modern, Unix-like desktop clients. The available
		management tools range from simple, image-based
		software distribution, mainly used for setting up
		uniform clients, to "intelligent" rule-based engines
		capable of search-and-replace operations on
		configuration files. We will briefly compare their
		properties and limitations, then take a closer look
		at Radmind, a suite for file level administration
		of Unix clients. Radmind has been in use in the
		Institute of Telecommunication at Technische
		Universitt Darmstadt for over three years, managing
		NetBSD and Debian Linux clients in the labs as well
		as faculty members' machines. We will explore the
		Radmind suite's underlying concepts and functionality.
		In order to see how the concept holds up, we will
		discuss real-world scenarios from the system
		life-cycle of Installation, configuration changes,
		security updates, component updates, and system
		upgrades.
		
		Hauke Fath works as a systems administrator for the
		Institut fr Nachrichtentechnik (telecommunication)
		at Technische Universitt Darmstadt. He has been
		using NetBSD since 1994, when he first booted a
		NetBSD 1.0A kernel on a Macintosh SE/30. NetBSD
		helped shaping his career by causing a slow drift
		from application programmer's work towards systems
		and network administration. Hauke Fath holds a MS
		in Physics and became a NetBSD developer in late
		2006.

		This paper discusses the NetBSD Power Management
		Framework (PMF) and related changes to the kernel.
		The outlined changes allow NetBSD to support essential
		functions like suspend-to-RAM on most post-Y2K X86
		machines. They are also the fundation for intelligent
		handling of device activity by enabling devices
		on-demand. This work is still progressing. Many of
		the features will be available in the up-coming
		NetBSD 5.0 release The NetBSD kernel is widely
		regarded to be one of the cleanest and most portable
		Operating System kernels available. For various
		reasons it is also assumed that NetBSD only runs
		well on older hardware. In the summer of 2006 Charles
		Hannum, one of the founders of NetBSD, left with a
		long mail mentioning as important issues the lack
		of proper power management and suspendto- RAM
		support. One year later, Jared D. McNeill posted a
		plan for attacking this issue based on ideas derived
		from the Windows Driver Model. This plan would
		evolve into the new NetBSD Power Management Framework
		(PMF for short).

		The Aerospace Corporation operates a federally
		funded research and development center in support
		of national-security, civil and commercial space
		programs. Many of our 2400+ engineers use a variety
		of computing technologies to support their work.
		Applications range from small models which are
		easily handled by desktops to parameter studies
		involving thousands of cpu hours and traditional,
		large scale parallel codes such as computational
		fluid dynamics and molecular modeling applications.
		Our primary resources used to support these large
		applications are computing clusters. Our current
		primary cluster, the Fellowship cluster consists
		of 352 dual-processor nodes with a total of 14xx
		cores. Two additional clusters, beginning at 150
		dual-processor nodes each are being constructed to
		augment Fellowship. As in In any multiuser computing
		environment with limited resources, user competition
		for resources is a significant burden. Users want
		everything they need to do their job, right now.
		Unfortunately, other users may need those resources
		at the same time. Thus, systems to arbitrate this
		resource contention are necessary. On Fellowship
		we have deployed the Sun Grid Engine scheduler which
		scheduled batch jobs across the nodes. In the next
		section we discuss the performance problems that
		can occur when sharing resources in a high performance
		computing cluster. We then discuss range of
		possibilities to address these problems. We then
		explain the solutions we are investigating and
		describe our experiments with them. We then conclude
		with a discussion of future work.

		The University of Toronto is a large educational
		institutional with over 70,000 students and 10,000
		staff and faculty. For the past three years, we
		have developed and implemented a ubiquitous VPN
		service, based up on OpenVPN and FreeBSD. The service
		has over 3000 active customers, with up to 35
		simultaneous users. The system supports, Linux, Mac
		OS X and Windows XP/Vista/2000 clients. Tools have
		been developed to create a central CA which enables
		users to log in to a secure server and get their
		customized client, certificates and configuration.
		The NSIS installer is used to generate the customized
		windows installers. Similar packages are generated
		for the various Unix based clients. Additional
		WWW/PHP based tools, have been developed to monitor
		and log usage of the service, using standard graphs,
		alarms for excessive use and a certificate revocation
		mechanism. The system has been integrated into the
		local identity management system (Kerberos/LDAP)
		in order to authorize and authenticate users upon
		initiation and per session usage. All code is Open
		Source and freely available.

		The Google Summer of Code is a program designed to
		provide students with real world experience
		contributing to open source projects during the
		summer break in university studies. Each year Google
		selects a number of open source projects to act as
		mentoring organizations. Students are invited to
		submit project proposals for the open source projects
		that are most interesting to them. FreeBSD was one
		of the projects selected to participate in the
		inaugural Summer of Code in 2005 and we have
		participated each year since then. Over the past 4
		years a total of 79 students have participated in
		the program and it has become a very significant
		source of new committers to FreeBSD. This talk will
		examine in detail the selection criteria for projects,
		the impact that successful projects have had, and
		some suggestions for how we can better leverage
		this program in the future.

		ABSD/UNIX operating system is traditionally split
		into two pieces: the kernel and userspace. Historically
		the reasons for this were clear: the UNIX kernel
		was a simple entity. However, over time the kernel
		has grown more and more complex. Currently, most
		of the same functionality is available both in
		userspace and the kernel, but under different names.
		Examples include synchronization routines and
		threading support. For instance, to lock a mutex
		in the NetBSD kernel, the call is mutex_enter(),
		while in userspace the routine which does exactly
		the same thing is known as pthread_mutex_enter().
		Taking another classic example, a BSD style OS has
		malloc()/free() available both in userspace and the
		kernel, but with different linkage (the kernel
		malloc interface is currently being widely deprecated,
		though). This imposes a completely arbitrary division
		between the kernel and userspace. Most functionality
		provided by an opearating system should be treated
		as a service instead of explicitly pinning it down
		as a userspace daemon or a kernel driver. Currently,
		due to the arbitrarily difference in programming
		interface names, functionality must be explicitly
		ported between the kernel and userspace if it is
		to run in one or the other environment. By unifying
		the environments where possible, the arbitrary
		division is weakened and porting between these
		environments becomes simpler.
		
		Antti Kantee has been a NetBSD developer for many
		many moons. He has managed to work on quite a few
		bits and pieces of a BSD system: userland utilities,
		the pkgsrc packaging system, networking, virtual
		memory, device drivers, hardware support and file
		systems.

		This talk will present the different layers that
		handle input, from the key that gets pressed or the
		mouse motion to the applications, all the way through
		the kernel drivers, X drivers and libraries, in the
		case of the OpenBSD/NetBSD wscons driver and the
		current and future X.Org server. It will cover stuff
		like keyboard mappings, touch-screen calibration,
		multi-pointer X or input coordinates transformations.
		It will show some problems of current implementations
		and try to show how current evolutions can solve
		them.
		
		Matthieu Herrb is maintaing X on OpenBSD. I've been
		using X on various systems (SunOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
		Mac OS X,...) since 1989. He has been a member of
		the XFree86 Core Team for a short period in 2003
		and is now a member of the X.Org Foundation BoD.

		Robert Watson will describe the design and application
		of the TrustedBSD MAC Framework, a flexible kernel
		security framework developed on FreeBSD, and recently
		experimentally ported to Apple's Darwin operating
		system. The MAC Framework permits loadable access
		control kernel modules to be loaded, modifying the
		security behavior of the operating system, including
		SEBSD, a port of the SELinux FLASK/TE security model
		to FreeBSD.

		this conference.
		
		OpenBSM is a BSD-licensed implementation of Sun's
		Basic Security Module (BSM) API and file format,
		and is the foundation of the TrustedBSD audit
		implementation for FreeBSD. This talk will cover
		the requirements, design, and implementation of
		audit support for FreeBSD. Security audit support
		provides detailed logging of security-relevant
		events, and meets the requirements of the CAPP
		Common Criteria protection profile.

		EuroBSDCon 2006 took place in Milan, Italy, and not
		only offered excellent food on a flexible schedule,
		but also an interesting array of talks on work
		spanning the BSD's. On this page, you can find my
		slides from the FreeBSD developer summit and full
		conference.
		
		Status report on the TrustedBSD Project: introduction
		and status regarding Audit, plus a TODO list;
		introduction to the priv(9) work recently merged
		to 7.x.
		
		The FreeBSD Project is one of the oldest and most
		successful open source operating system projects,
		seeing wide deployment across the IT industry. From
		the root name servers, to top tier ISPs, to core
		router operating systems, to firewalls, to embedded
		appliances, you can't use a networked computer for
		ten minutes without using FreeBSD dozens of times.
		Part of FreeBSD's reputation for quality and
		reliability comes from the nature of its development
		organization--driven by a hundreds of highly skilled
		volunteers, from high school students to university
		professors. And unlike most open source projects,
		the FreeBSD Project has developers who have been
		working on the same source base for over twenty
		years. But how does this organization work? Who
		pays the bandwidth bills, runs the web servers,
		writes the documentation, writes the code, and calls
		the shots? And how can developers in a dozen time
		zones reach agreement on the time of day, let alone
		a kernel architecture? This presentation will attempt
		to provide, in 45 minutes, a brief if entertaining
		snapshot into what makes FreeBSD run.

		EuroBSDCon 2005 took place in Basel, Switzerland
		in November, 2005. Due to an injury, I was unable
		to attend the conference itself, and my talks were
		presented in absentia by Poul-Henning Kamp and Ed
		Maste, who have my greatest appreciation!
		
		The FreeBSD SMPng Project has spent the past five
		years redesigning and reimplementing SMP support
		for the FreeBSD operating system, moving from a
		Giant-locked kernel to a fine-grained locking
		implementation with greater kernel threading and
		parallelism. This paper introduces the FreeBSD SMPng
		Project, its architectural goals and implementation
		approach. It then explores the impact of SMPng on
		the FreeBSD network stack, including strategies for
		integrating SMP support into the network stack,
		locking approaches, optimizations, and challenges.

		Robert Watson will describe a variety of pieces of
		work done as part of the TrustedBSD Project, including
		the TrustedBSD MAC Framework, Audit facilities for
		FreeBSD, as well as supporting infrastructure work
		such as GEOM/GBDE, UFS2, OpenPAM. He will also
		discuss how certification and evaluation play into
		feature selection, design, and documentation.

		The FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, Solaris, and Windows operating
		systems have kernels that provide comparable
		facilities. Interestingly, their code bases share
		almost no common parts, while their development
		processes vary dramatically. We analyze the source
		code of the four systems by collecting metrics in
		the areas of file organization, code structure,
		code style, the use of the C preprocessor, and data
		organization. The aggregate results indicate that
		across various areas and many different metrics,
		four systems developed using wildly different
		processes score comparably. This allows us to posit
		that the structure and internal quality attributes
		of a working, non-trivial software artifact will
		represent first and foremost the engineering
		requirements of its construction, with the influence
		of process being marginal, if any.

		FreeBSD is a sophisticated operating system developed
		and maintained as open-source software by a team
		of more than 350 individuals located throughout the
		world. This study uses developer location data, the
		configuration management repository, and records
		from the issue database to examine the extent of
		global development and its effect on productivity,
		quality, and developer cooperation. The key findings
		are that global development allows round-the-clock
		work, but there are some marked differences between
		the type of work performed at different regions.
		The effects of multiple dispersed developers on the
		quality of code and productivity are negligible.
		Mentoring appears to be sometimes associated with
		developers living closer together, but ad-hoc
		cooperation seems to work fine across continents.

		Speaker Bio
		
		Victor Duchovni trained in mathematics, switched
		tracks to CS in 1980s leaving Princeton with a
		master's degree in mathematics and newly acquired
		skills in Unix system administration and system
		programming. In 1990 moved to Lehman Brothers,
		worked on system management tooling, and network
		engineering. Ported "Moira" from MIT to Lehman,
		built efficient build systems that predated (and
		partly inspired) Jumpstart. In 1994 joined ESM to
		market "CMDB" tools to enterprise users, but this
		did not pan out, in the mean time learned Tcl, and
		contributed bunch of patches to the 7.x early 8.x
		TCL releases. In 1997 returned to New York, working
		in IT Security at Morgan Stanley since late 1999.
		At Morgan Stanley, developed a hobby in perimeter
		email security, becoming an active Postfix user and
		very soon contributor in May of 2001. In addition
		to many smaller feature improvements, contributed
		initial implementation of SMTP connection caching,
		overhauled and currently maintain LDAP and TLS
		support. Made significant design contributions to
		queue manager in collaboration with Wietse and
		Patrik Raq. In 2.6 contributing support for TLS EC
		ciphers and multi-instance management tooling,
		ideally also TLS SNI if time permits.

		Many modern CPUs provide on chip counters for
		performance events such as retiring instructions
		and cache misses. The hwpmc driver and libraries
		in FreeBSD give systems administrators and programmers
		access to APIs which make it possible to measure
		performance without modifying source code and with
		minimal intrusion into application execution. This
		talk will be a brief introduction to HWPMC, and how
		to use it.

		Two tools which have become the norm in Linux- and
		Unix-based environments are SSH for secure
		communications, and sudo for performing administrative
		tasks. These are independent programs with substantially
		different purposes, but they are often used in
		conjunction. In this talk, I describe a flaw in
		their interaction, and then present our solution
		called public-key sudo.
		
		Public-key sudo is an extension to the sudo
		authentication mechanism which allows for public
		key authentication using the SSH public key framework.
		I describe our implementation of a generic SSH
		authentication module and the sudo modifications
		required to use this module.

		Configuration Management with Cfengine
		
		Cfengine is a policy-based configuration management
		system. Its primary function is to provide automated

		policy specification.
		
		The cfengine project was started in 1993 as a
		reaction to the complexity and non-portability of
		shell scripting for Unix configuration management,
		and continues today. The aim was to absorb frequently
		used coding paradigms into a declarative, domain-specific
		language that would offer self-documenting
		configuration.

		Special NYC*BUG meeting with FreeBSD developer Brooks Davis
		
		Since late 2000 we have developed and maintained a
		general purpose technical and scientific computing
		cluster running the FreeBSD operating system. In
		that time we have grown from a cluster of 8 dual
		Intel Pentium III systems to our current mix of 64
		dual, quad-core Intel Xeon and 289 dual AMD Opteron
		systems.
		
		In this talk we reflect on the system architecture
		as documented in our BSDCon 2003 paper "Building a
		High-performance Computing Cluster Using FreeBSD"
		and our changes since that time. After a brief
		overview of the current cluster we revisit the
		architectural decisions in that paper and reflect
		on their long term success. We then discuss lessons
		learned in the process. Finally, we conclude with
		thoughts on future cluster expansion and designs.
		
		Bio
		
		Brooks Davis is an Engineering Specialist in the
		High Performance Computing Section of the Computer
		Systems Research Department at The Aerospace
		Corporation. He has been a FreeBSD user since 1994,
		a FreeBSD committer since 2001, and a core team
		member since 2006. He earned a Bachelors Degree in
		Computer Science from Harvey Mudd College in 1998.
		
		His computing interests include high performance
		computing, networking, security, mobility, and, of
		course, finding ways to use FreeBSD in all these
		areas. When not computing, he enjoys reading,
		cooking, brewing and pounding on red-hot iron in
		his garage blacksmith shop.

		SSARES: Secure Searchable Automated Remote Email
		Storage - A usable, secure email system on a remote
		untrusted server
		
		The increasing centralization of networked services
		places user data at considerable risk. For example,
		many users store email on remote servers rather
		than on their local disk. Doing so allows users to
		gain the benefit of regular backups and remote
		access, but it also places a great deal of unwarranted
		trust in the server. Since most email is stored in
		plaintext, a compromise of the server implies the
		loss of confidentiality and integrity of the email
		stored therein. Although users could employ an
		end-to-end encryption scheme (e.g., PGP), such
		measures are not widely adopted, require action on
		the sender side, only provide partial protection
		(the email headers remain in the clear), and prevent
		the users from performing some common operations,
		such as server-side search.
		
		To address this problem, we present Secure Searchable
		Automated Remote Email Storage (SSARES), a novel
		system that offers a practical approach to both
		securing remotely stored email and allowing
		privacy-preserving search of that email collection.
		Our solution encrypts email (the headers, body, and
		attachments) as it arrives on the server using
		public-key encryption. SSARES uses a combination
		of Identity Based Encryption and Bloom Filters to
		create a searchable index. This index reveals little
		information about search keywords and queries, even
		against adversaries that compromise the server.
		SSARES remains largely transparent to both the
		sender and recipient. However, the system also
		incurs significant costs, primarily in terms of
		expanded storage requirements. We view our work as
		a starting point toward creating privacy-friendly
		hosted services.

		Cryptography has a reputation of slowing down

		actually be used to improve performance by storing
		high-value/high-cost results "in public." In addition
		the same techniques can solve common security

		All are welcome - no previous experience with
		cryptography is required, and the techniques will
		be presented in a programming-language neutral
		format.

		how to install it
		how to configure it
		how to customize it for your environment
		where the data is stored
		how to write a basic plug-in
		
		
		About the Speaker
		Marc Spitzer started as a VAX/VMS operator who
		taught himself some basic scripting in DCL to help
		me remember how to do procedures that did not come
		up enough to actually remember all the steps, this
		was in 1990. Since then he has worked with HPUX,
		Solaris, Windows, Linux, and the BSDs, FreeBSD being
		his favorite. He has held a variety of positions,
		admin and engineering, where he has been able to
		introduce BSD into his work place. He currently
		works for Columbia University as a Systems
		Administrator.
		
		He is a founding member of NYCBUG and LispNYC and
		on the board of UNIGroup.
		
		Most of his career has been building tools to solve

		"The Real Unix Tradition"
		
		UNIX hackers, all standing on the shoulders of giants.
		
		"...the number of UNIX installations has grown to
		10, with more expected..." - Dennis Ritchie and Ken
		Thompson, June 1972
		
		"Well, it was all Open Source, before anybody really
		called it that". - Brian Redman, 2003
		
		UNIX is the oldest active and growing computing
		culture alive today. From it's humble roots in the
		back room at Bell Laboratories, to today's global
		internet infrastructure- UNIX has consistently been
		at the core of major advances in computing. Today,
		the BSD legacy is the most direct continuation of
		the most successful principles in UNIX, and continues
		to lead major advances in computing.
		
		Why? What's so great about UNIX?
		
		This lecture aims to prove that UNIX history is
		surprisingly useful (and fun)- for developers,
		sysadmins, and anyone working with BSD systems.
		
		About the speaker
		Isaac Levy, (ike) is a freelance BSD hadker based
		in NYC. He runs Diversaform Inc. as an engine to
		make his hacking feed itself, (and ike). Diversaform
		specializes in *BSD based solutions, providing 'IT
		special weapons and tatics' for various sized
		business clients, as well as running a small
		high-availability datacenter operation from lower
		Manhattan. With regard to FreeBSD jail(8), ike was
		a partner in the first jail (8)-based web hosting
		ISP in America, iMeme, and has been developing
		internet applications in and out of jails since
		1999. Isaac is a proud member of NYC*BUG (the New
		York City *BSD Users Group), and a long time member
		of LESMUUG, (the Lower East Side Mac Unix Users
		Group).

		Integrated Enterprise Security Management
		
		Security policies are a key component in protecting
		enterprise networks. But, while there are many
		diverse defensive options available, current models
		and mechanisms for mechanically-enforced security
		policies are limited to traditional admission-based
		access control. Defensive capabilities include among
		others logging, firewalls, honeypots, rollback/recovery,
		and intrusion detection systems, while policy
		enforcement is essentially limited to one-off access
		control. Furthermore, access-control mechanisms
		operate independently on each service, which can
		(and often does) lead to inconsistent or incorrect
		application of the intended system-wide policy. We
		propose a new scheme for global security policies.
		Every policy decision is made with near-global
		knowledge, and re-evaluated as global knowledge
		changes. Using a variety of actuators, we make the

		The presentation will discuss Subversion from both
		client and server points of view. It will show how
		to create repositories and how to make them accessible
		over the network using different access schemes
		like http://, file:// or svn://. Pointers are given
		on securing the repositories and on authenticating
		and authorizing the clients.  Next, the presentation
		shows how an user interacts with the repository and
		describes some of the important Subversion client
		commands.  Finally, it deals with administrating
		the repository using "hook scripts".
		
		Ivan Ivanov is generally interested in Version
		Control Systems since his student years in Sofia
		University, Bulgaria, where he set up and maintained
		a CVS server for an academic project. When Subversion
		became a fact and proved to be "a better CVS" he
		researched it and last year deployed it for his
		NYC-based employer Ariel Partners
		(http://www.arielpartners.com/). He integrated the
		Subversion repositories with Apache Web Server over
		https to enable a reliable and secure way to access
		them from any point.

		First and foremost, I would like to thank the unique
		presentation styles of Dick Hardt and Lawrence
		Lessig for inspiring me to create this presentation.
		
		The following videos were created by exporting the
		original Keynote presentation slides into QuickTime
		video, then manually synchronizing them using iMovie
		HD with the audio recordings captured by Nikolai
		Fetissov. They were then exported into QuickTime,
		mpeg4 (H.264/AAC), and iPod movie formats. If you
		are having difficulties with the MP4 copy, and are
		unable to view QuickTime movies, please contact me
		and I'll try to assist.

		UNIX professionals are busy these days. Setting up
		routers and firewalls are fundamental to any network,
		but in environments where the focus is on various
		applications, (servers, workstations, and the
		software that runs on them), it's difficult for a
		business not to choose off-the-shelf SOHO routers
		and networking gear. The web management GUIs are
		understandable by everyone, (even techs without
		UNIX knowledge), and the gear is cheap - this saves
		time and money.
		
		In the meantime, the features of your average Linksys
		or Netgear router often leave MUCH to be desired,
		(https auth management, for one simple example).
		
		Enter m0n0wall and PFSense, 2 BSD based packaged
		router/firewall solutions that are as solid and
		full featured as you'd expect from any BSD system-
		PLUS THEY HAVE HTML WEB INTERFACES FOR MANAGEMENT!
		
		m0n0wall and PFSense become an easy sell in any
		small professional environment, any competent tech
		can manage the network within minutes... At home,
		in every hackers home network, they free the hacker
		to have trusted tools available, but are as time-saving
		as using any Linksys router.
		
		m0n0wall and PFSense are both light and clean,
		designed to run on embedded systems- (Soekris,
		WRAP), but are monsters when unleashed on even
		legacy PCs around the office. If you manage UNIX
		networks and systems all day, do you really want
		to manage the router for your DSL when you get home?
		But then doesn't it bug you to use a chincey Linksys
		box?
		
		Ike has been a member of NYC*BUG since we first
		launched in January 2004. He is a long-time member
		of the Lower East Side Mac Unix User Group. He has
		spoken frequently on a number of topics at various
		venues, particularly on the issue of FreeBSD's jail
		(8).

		Our Topic:
		Network Protocol Development Tools and Techniques for FreeBSD
		
		Our Speaker:
		George Neville-Neil, co-author of the "Design and
		Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System"
		"daemon" book.
		
		Our Topic:
		While computers have gotten faster and more powerful
		the tools we use to develop network protocols, such
		as TCP, UDP, IPv4 and IPv6 have not.  Most network
		protocols are developed, in C, in the kernel, and
		require a lot of work to test. Over the past year
		or so I have been working with virtual machines, a
		couple of pieces of open source software, and begun
		developing a library for use in protocol testing.
		This talk will cover three topics:
		
		Developing and testing kernel code with Virtual Machines
		Finding good tests for networking code
		Packet Construction Set (PCS) a new library for
		    writing protocol tests

		COMPLETE Hard Disk Encryption with FreeBSD, by Marc Schiesser
		
		Learn how to effectively protect not only your data
		but also your applications.
		
		Most technologies and techniques intended for
		securing digital data focus on protection while the
		machine is turned on  mostly by defending against
		remote attacks. An attacker with physical access
		to the machine, however, can easily circumvent these
		defenses by reading out the contents of the storage
		medium on a different, fully accessible system or
		even compromise program code on it in order to leak
		encrypted information. Especially for mobile users,
		that threat is real. And for those carrying around
		sensitive data, the risk is most likely high. This
		talk will introduce a method of mitigating that
		particular risk by protecting not only the data
		through encryption, but also the applications and
		the operating system from being compromised while
		the machine is turned off.

		Nearly 10 years ago Kirk McKusick wrote a history
		of the Berkeley Unix distributions for the O'Reilly
		book "Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source
		Revolution". We recommend you read his story,
		entitled "Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix From
		AT&amp;T-Owned to Freely Redistributable" first, to see
		how Kirk remembers how we got here. Sadly, since
		it showed up in book form originally, this text has
		probably not been read by enough people.
		
		
		The USL(AT&amp;T) vs BSDI/UCB court case settlement
		documents were not public until recently; their
		disclosure has made the facts more clear. But the
		story of how three people decided to free the BSD
		codebase of corporate pollution -- and release it
		freely -- is more interesting than the lawsuit which
		followed. Sure, a stupid lawsuit happened which
		hindered the acceptance of the BSD code during a
		critical period. But how did a bunch of guys go
		through the effort of replacing so much AT&amp;T code
		in the first place? After all, companies had lots
		of really evil lawyers back then too -- were they
		not afraid?
		
		
		After a decade of development, most of the AT&amp;T
		code had already been replaced by university
		researchers and their associates. So Keith Bostic,
		Mike Karels and Kirk McKusick (the main UCB CSRG
		group) started going through the 4.3BSD codebase
		to cleanse the rest. Keith, in particular, built a
		ragtag team (in those days, USENIX conferences were
		a gold mine for such team building) and led these
		rebels to rewrite and replace all the Imperial AT&amp;T
		code, piece by piece, starting with the libraries
		and userland programs. Anyone who helped only got
		credit as a Contributor -- people like Chris Torek
		and a cast of .. hundreds more.
		
		
		Then Mike and Kirk purified the kernel. After a bit
		more careful checking, this led to the release of
		a clean tree called Net/2 which was given to the
		world in June 1991 -- the largest dump of free
		source code the world had ever received (for those
		days -- not modern monsters like OpenOffice).
		
		
		Some of these ragtags formed a company (BSDi) to
		sell a production system based on this free code
		base, and a year later Unix System Laboratories
		(basically AT&amp;T) sued BSDi and UCB. Eventually
		AT&amp;T lost and after a few trifling fixes (described
		in the lawsuit documents) the codebase was free. A
		few newer developments (and more free code) were
		added, and released in June 1994 as 4.4BSD-Lite.
		Just over 14 years later OpenBSD is releasing its
		own 4.4 release (and for a lot less than $1000 per
		copy).
		
		
		The OpenBSD 4.4 release is dedicated to Keith Bostic,
		Mike Karels, Kirk McKusick, and all of those who
		contributed to making Net/2 and 4.4BSD-Lite free.

		We are just plain tired of being lectured to by a
		man who is a lot like Naomi Campbell.
		
		In 1998 when a United Airlines plane was waiting
		in the queue at Washington Dulles International
		Airport for take-off to New Orleans (where a Usenix
		conference was taking place), one man stood up from
		his seat, demanded that they stop waiting in the
		queue and be permitted to deplane. Even after orders
		from the crew and a pilot from the cockpit he refused
		to sit down. The plane exited the queue and returned
		to the airport gangway. Security personnel ran onto
		the plane and removed this man, Richard Stallman,
		from the plane. After Richard was removed from the
		plane, everyone else stayed onboard and continued
		their journey to New Orleans. A few OpenBSD developers
		were on that same plane, seated very closeby, so
		we have an accurate story of the events.
		
		This is the man who presumes that he should preach
		to us about morality, freedom, and what is best for
		us. He believes it is his God-given role to tell
		us what is best for us, when he has shown that he
		takes actions which are not best for everyone. He
		prefers actions which he thinks are best for him
		-- and him alone -- and then lies to the public.
		Richard Stallman is no Spock.
		
		We release our software in ways that are maximally
		free. We remove all restrictions on use and
		distribution, but leave a requirement to be known
		as the authors. We follow a pattern of free source
		code distribution that started in the mid-1980's
		in Berkeley, from before Richard Stallman had any
		powerful influence which he could use so falsely.
		
		We have a development sub-tree called "ports". Our
		"ports" tree builds software that is 'found on the
		net' into packages that OpenBSD users can use more
		easily. A scaffold of Makefiles and scripts
		automatically fetch these pieces of software, apply
		patches as required by OpenBSD, and then build them
		into nice neat little tarballs. This is provided
		as a convenience for users. The ports tree is
		maintained by OpenBSD entirely separately from our
		main source tree. Some of the software which is
		fetched and compiled is not as free as we would
		like, but what can we do. All the other operating
		system projects make exactly the same decision, and
		provide these same conveniences to their users.
		
		Richard felt that this "ports tree" of ours made
		OpenBSD non-free. He came to our mailing lists and
		lectured to us specifically, yet he said nothing
		to the many other vendors who do the same; many of
		them donate to the FSF and perhaps that has something
		to do with it. Meanwhile, Richard has personally
		made sure that all the official GNU software --
		including Emacs -- compiles and runs on Windows.
		
		That man is a false leader. He is a hypocrite. There
		may be some people who listen to him. But we don't
		listen to people who do not follow their own stupid
		rules.

		Those of us who work on OpenBSD are often asked why
		we do what we do. This song's lyrics express the
		core motivations and goals which have remained
		unchanged over the years - secure, free, reliable
		software, that can be shared with anyone. Many other
		projects purport to share these same goals, and
		love to wrap themselves in a banner of "Open Source"
		and "Free Software". Given how many projects there
		are one would think it might be easy to stick to
		those goals, but it doesn't seem to work out that
		way. A variety of desires drag many projects away
		from the ideals very quickly.
		
		Much of any operating system's usability depends
		on device support, and there are some very tempting
		alternative ways to support devices available to
		those who will surrender their moral code. A project
		could compromise by entering into NDA agreements
		with vendors, or including binary objects in the
		operating system for which no source code exists,
		or tying their users down with contract terms hidden
		inside copyright notices. All of these choices
		surrender some subset of the ideals, and we simply
		will not do this. Sure, we care about getting devices
		working, but not at the expense of our original
		goals.
		
		Of course since "free to share with anyone" is part
		of our goals, we've been at the forefront of many
		licensing and NDA issues, resulting in a good number
		of successes. This success had led to much recognition
		for the advancement of Free Software causes, but
		has also led to other issues.
		
		We fully admit that some BSD licensed software has
		been taken and used by many commercial entities,
		but contributions come back more often than people
		seem to know, and when they do, they're always still
		properly attributed to the original authors, and
		given back in the same spirit that they were given
		in the first place.
		
		That's the best we can expect from companies. After
		all, we make our stuff so free so that everyone can
		benefit -- it remains a core goal; we really have
		not strayed at all in 10 years. But we can expect
		more from projects who talk about sharing -- such
		as the various Linux projects.
		
		Now rather than seeing us as friends who can
		cooperatively improve all codebases, we are seen
		as foes who oppose the GPL. The participants of
		"the race" are being manipulated by the FSF and
		their legal arm, the SFLC, for the FSF's aims,
		rather than the goal of getting good source into
		Linux (and all other code bases). We don't want
		this to come off as some conspiracy theory, but we
		simply urge those developers caution -- they should
		ensure that the path they are being shown by those
		who have positioned themselves as leaders is still
		true. Run for yourself, not for their agenda.
		
		The Race is there to be run, for ourselves, not for
		others. We do what we do to run our own race, and
		finish it the best we can. We don't rush off at
		every distraction, or worry how this will affect
		our image. We are here to have fun doing right.

      <title>OpenBSD 4.1 Release Song - Puffy Baba and the 40 Vendors</title>

		As developers of a free operating system, one of
		our prime responsibilities is device support. No
		matter how nice an operating system is, it remains
		useless and unusable without solid support for a
		wide percentage of the hardware that is available
		on the market. It is therefore rather unsurprising
		that more than half of our efforts focus on various
		aspects relating to device support.
		
		Most parts of the operating system (from low kernel,
		through to libraries, all the way up to X, and then
		even to applications) use fairly obvious interface
		layers, where the "communication protocols" or
		"argument passing" mechanisms (ie. APIs) can be
		understood by any developer who takes the time to
		read the free code. Device drivers pose an additional
		and significant challenge though: because many
		vendors refuse to document the exact behavior of
		their devices.  The devices are black boxes. And
		often they are surprisingly weird, or even buggy.
		
		When vendor documentation does not exist, the
		development process can become extremely hairy.
		Groups of developers have found themselves focused
		for months at a time, figuring out the most simple
		steps, simply because the hardware is a complete
		mystery. Access to documentation can ease these
		difficulties rapidly. However, getting access to
		the chip documentation from vendors is ... almost
		always a negotiation. If we had open access to
		documentation, anyone would be able to see how
		simple all these devices actually are, and device
		driver development would flourish (and not just in
		OpenBSD, either).
		
		When we proceed into negotiations with vendors,
		asking for documentation, our position is often
		weak. One would assume that the modern market is
		fair, and that selling chips would be the primary
		focus of these vendors. But unfortunately a number
		of behemoth software vendors have spent the last
		10 or 20 years building political
		hurdles against the smaller players.
		
		A particularly nasty player in this regard has been
		the Linux vendors and some Linux developers, who
		have played along with an American corporate model
		of requiring NDAs for chip documentation. This has
		effectively put Linux into the club with Microsoft,
		but has left all the other operating system communities
		-- and their developers -- with much less available
		clout for requesting documentation. In a more fair
		world, the Linux vendors would work with us, and
		the device driver support in all free operating
		systems would be fantastic by now.
		
		We only ask that users
		help us in changing the political landscape.

		The last 10 years, every 6 month period has (without
		fail) resulted in an official OpenBSD release making
		it to the FTP servers. But CDs are also manufactured,
		which the project sells to continue our development
		goals.
		
		While tests of the release binaries are done by
		developers around the world, Theo and some developers
		from Calgary or Edmonton (such as Peter Valchev or
		Bob Beck) test that the discs are full of (only)
		correct code. Ty Semaka works for approximately two
		months to design and draw artwork that will fit the
		designated theme, and coordinates with his music
		buddies to write and record a song that also matches
		the theme.
		
		Then the discs and all the artwork gets delivered
		to the plant, so that they can be pressed in time
		for an official release date.
		
		This release, instead of bemoaning vendors or
		organizations that try to make our task of writing
		free software more difficult, we instead celebrate
		the 10 years that we have been given (so far) to
		write free software, express our themes in art, and
		the 5 years that we have made music with a group
		of talented musicians.
		
		OpenBSD developers have been torturing each other
		for years now with Humppa-style music, so this
		release our users get a taste of this too. Sometimes
		at hackathons you will hear the same songs being
		played on multiple laptops, out of sync. It is under
		such duress that much of our code gets written.
		
		We feel like Pufferix and Bobilix delivering The
		Three Discs of Freedom to those who want them
		whenever the need arises, then returning to celebrate
		the (unlocked) source tree with all the other
		developers.
		
		For RSS readers: Please note that the download URL
		is an FTP site.

		Last month I attended a meeting of the Ottawa Amateur
		Radio Club (OARC)
		as a member of my local BUG was giving a presentation
		on Ham Radio on FreeBSD. Diane
		Bruce, call sign VA3DB, has had her operator
		license since 1969 and is well known in the BSD
		community and for the development of ircd-hybrid.
		In the past year she has assisted in the creation
		of the Hamradio
		category in the FreeBSD ports tree and has
		become the maintainer of over 20 of the hamradio
		ports.  She also contributed to the FreeBSD
		entry at Hampedia, the Wikipedia for ham
		operators.
		
		Her presentation slides are a great introduction
		to the various ham utilities which are available,
		including both descriptions and screenshots of the
		utilities in action.

		pfSense: 2.0 and beyond
		From firewall distribution to appliance building platform
		
		pfSense is a BSD licensed customized distribution
		of FreeBSD tailored for use as a firewall and router.
		In addition to being a powerful, flexible firewalling
		and routing platform, it includes a long list of
		related features and a package system allowing
		further expandability without adding bloat and
		potential security vulnerabilities to the base
		distribution.
		
		This session will start with an introduction to the
		project and its common uses, which have expanded
		considerably beyond firewalling. We will cover much
		of the new functionality coming in the 2.0 release,
		which contains significant enhancements to nearly
		every portion of the system as well as numerous new
		features.
		
		While the primary function of the project is a
		firewalling and routing platform, with changes
		coming in pfSense 2.0, it has also become an appliance
		building framework enabling the creation of customized
		special purpose appliances. The m0n0wall code where
		pfSense originated has proved popular for this
		purpose, with AskoziaPBX and FreeNAS also based
		upon it, in addition to a number of commercial
		solutions. The goal of this appliance building
		framework is to enable creation of projects such
		as these without having to fork and maintain another
		code base. The existing appliances, including a DNS
		server using TinyDNS, VoIP with FreeSWITCH, and
		others will be discussed. For those interested in
		creating appliances, an overview of the process
		will be provided along with references for additional
		information.

		GEOM based disk schedulers for FreeBSD
		
		The high cost of seek operations makes the throughput
		of disk devices very sensitive to the offered
		workload. A disk scheduler can then help reorder
		requests to improve the overall throughput of the
		device, or improve the service guarantees for
		individual users, or both.
		
		Research results in recent years have introduced,
		and proven the effectiveness of, a technique called
		"anticipatory scheduling". The basic idea behind
		this technique is that, in some cases, requests
		that cause a seek should not be served immediately;
		instead, the scheduler should wait for a short
		period of time in case other requests arrive that
		do not require a seek to be served. With many common
		workloads, dominated by sequential synchronous
		requests, the potential loss of throughput caused
		by the disk idling times is more than balanced by
		the overall reduction of seeks.
		
		While a fair amount of research on disk scheduling
		has been conducted on FreeBSD, the results were
		never integrated in the OS, perhaps because the
		various prototype implementations were very
		device-specific and operated within the device
		drivers. Ironically, anticipatory schedulers are
		instead a standard part of Linux kernels.
		
		This talk has two major contributions:
		
		First, we will show how, thanks to the flexibility
		of the GEOM architecture, an anticipatory disk
		scheduling framework has been implemented in FreeBSD
		with little or no modification to a GENERIC kernel.
		While these schedulers operate slightly above the
		layer where one would naturally put a scheduler,
		they can still achieve substantial performance
		improvements over the standard disk scheduler; in
		particular, even the simplest anticipatory schedulers
		can prevent the complete trashing of the disk
		performance that often occurs in presence of multiple
		processes accessing the disk.
		
		Secondly, we will discuss how the basic anticipatory
		scheduling technique can be used not only to improve
		the overall throughput of the disk, but also to
		give service guarantees to individual disk clients,
		a feature that is extremely important in practice
		e.g., when serving applications with pseudo-real-time
		constraints such as audio or video streaming ones.
		
		A prototype implementation of the scheduler that
		will be covered in the presentation is available
		at http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/FreeBSD/

		Quiet Computing with BSD
		Programming system hardware monitors for quiet computing
		
		In this talk, we will present a detailed overview
		of the features and common problems of microprocessor
		system hardware monitors as they relate to the topic
		of silent computing. In a nutshell, the topic of
		programmable fan control will be explored.
		
		Silent computing is an important subject as its
		practice reduces the amount of unnecessary stress
		and improves the motivation of the workforce, at
		home and in the office.
		
		Attendees will gain knowledge on how to effectively
		programme the chips to minimise fan noise and avoid
		system failure or shutdown during temperature
		fluctuations, as well as some basic principles
		regarding quiet computing.
		
		Shortly before the talk, a patch for programming
		the most popular chips (like those from Winbond)
		will be released for the OpenBSD operating system,
		although the talk itself will be more specific to
		the microprocessor system hardware monitors themselves,
		as opposed to the interfacing with thereof in modern
		operating systems like OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly
		BSD and FreeBSD.

		Results of a Security Assessment of the TCP and IP
		protocols and Common implementation Strategies
		
		Fernando Gont will present the results of security
		assessment of the TCP and IP protocols carried out
		on behalf of the United Kingdom's Centre for the
		Protection of National Infrastructure (Centre for
		the Protection of National Infrastructure). His
		presentation will provide an overview of the
		aforementioned project, and will describe some of
		the new insights that were gained as a result of
		this project. Additionally, it will provide an
		overview of the state of affairs of the different
		TCP/IP implementations found in BSD operating systems
		with respect to the aforementioned issues.
		
		During the last twenty years, many vulnerabilities
		have been identified in the TCP/IP stacks of a
		number of systems. The discovery of these vulnerabilities
		led in most cases to reports being published by a
		number of CSIRTs and vendors, which helped to raise
		awareness about the threats and the best possible
		mitigations known at the time the reports were
		published. For some reason, much of the effort of
		the security community on the Internet protocols
		did not result in official documents (RFCs) being
		issued by the organization in charge of the
		standardization of the communication protocols in
		use by the Internet: the Internet Engineering Task
		Force (IETF). This basically led to a situation in
		which "known" security problems have not always
		been addressed by all vendors. In addition, in many
		cases vendors have implemented quick "fixes" to the
		identified vulnerabilities without a careful analysis
		of their effectiveness and their impact on
		interoperability. As a result, producing a secure
		TCP/IP implementation nowadays is a very difficult
		task, in large part because of the hard task of
		identifying relevant documentation and differentiating
		between that which provides correct advisory, and
		that which provides misleading advisory based on
		inaccurate or wrong assumptions. During 2006, the
		United Kingdom's Centre for the Protection of
		National Infrastructure embarked itself in an
		ambitious and arduous project: performing a security
		assessment of the TCP and IP protocols. The project
		did not limit itself to an analysis of the relevant
		IETF specifications, but also included an analysis
		of common implementation strategies found in the
		most popular TCP and IP implementations. The result
		of the project was a set of documents which identifies
		possible threats for the TCP and IP protocols and,
		where possible, proposes counter-measures to mitigate
		the identified threats. This presentation will
		describe some of the new insights that were gained
		as a result of this project. Additionally, it will
		provide an overview of the state of affairs of the
		different TCP/IP implementations found in BSD
		operating systems.

		Isolating Cluster Jobs for Performance and Predictability
		
		At The Aerospace Corporation, we run a large FreeBSD
		based computing cluster to support engineering
		applications. These applications come in all shapes,
		sizes, and qualities of implementation. To support
		them and our diverse userbase we have been searching
		for ways to isolate jobs from one another in ways
		that are more effective than Unix time sharing and
		more fine grained than allocating whole nodes to
		jobs.
		
		In this talk we discuss the problem space and our
		efforts so far. These efforts include implementation
		of partial file systems virtualization and CPU
		isolation using CPU sets.

		Multiple Passes of the FreeBSD Device Tree
		
		The existing device driver framework in FreeBSD
		works fairly well for many tasks. However, there
		are a few problems that are not easily solved with
		the current design. These problems include having
		"real" device drivers for low-level hardware such
		as clocks and interrupt controllers, proper resource
		discovery and management, and allowing most drivers
		to always probe and attach in an environment where
		interrupts are enabled. I propose extending the
		device driver framework to support multiple passes
		over the device tree during boot. This would allow
		certain classes of drivers to be attached earlier
		and perform boot-time setup before other drivers
		are probed and attached. This in turn can be used
		to develop solutions to the earlier list of problems.

		scrypt: A new key derivation function
		Doing our best to thwart TLAs armed with ASICs
		
		Password-based key derivation functions are used
		for two primary purposes: First, to hash passwords
		so that an attacker who gains access to a password
		file does not immediately possess the passwords
		contained therewithin; and second, to generate
		cryptographic keys to be used for encrypting or
		authenticating data.
		
		In both cases, if passwords do not have sufficient
		entropy, an attacker with the relevant data can
		perform a brute force attack, hashing potential
		passwords repeatedly until the correct key is found.
		While commonly used key derivation functions, such
		as Kamp's iterated MD5, Provos and Mazieres' bcrypt,
		and RSA Laboratories' PBKDF1 and PBKDF2 make an
		attempt to increase the difficulty of brute-force
		attacks, they all require very little memory, making
		them ideally suited to attack by custom hardware.
		
		In this talk, I will introduce the concepts of
		memory-hard and sequential memory-hard functions,
		and argue that key derivation functions should be
		sequential memory-hard. I will present a key
		derivation function which, subject to common
		assumptions about cryptographic hash functions, is
		provably sequential memory-hard, and a variation
		which appears to be stronger (but not provably so).
		Finally, I will provide some estimates of the cost
		of performing brute force attacks on a variety of
		password strengths and key derivation functions.

		Tracking FreeBSD in a commercial Environment
		How to stay current while staying sane
		
		The FreeBSD project publishes two lines of source
		code: current and stable. All changes must first
		be committed to current and then are merged into
		stable. Commercial organizations wishing to use
		FreeBSD in their products must be aware of this
		policy. Four different strategies have developed
		for tracking FreeBSD over time. A company can choose
		to run only unmodified release versions of FreeBSD.
		A company may choose to import FreeBSD's sources
		once and then never merge newer versions. A company
		can choose to import each new stable branch as it
		is created, adding its own changes to that branch,
		as well as integrating new versions from FreeBSD
		from time to time. A company can track FreeBSD's
		current branch, adding to it their changes as well
		as newer FreeBSD changes. Which method a company
		chooses depends on the needs of the company. These
		methods are explored in detail, and their advantages
		and disadvantages are discussed. Tracking FreeBSD's
		ports and packages is not discussed.
		
		Companies building products based upon FreeBSD have
		many choices in how to use the projects sources and
		binaries. The choices range from using unmodified
		binaries from FreeBSD's releases, to tracking modify
		FreeBSD heavily and tracking FreeBSD's evolution
		in a merged tree. Some companies may only need to
		maintain a stable version of FreeBSD with more bug
		fixes or customizations than the FreeBSD project
		wishes to place in that branch. Some companies also
		wish to contribute some subset of their changes
		back to the FreeBSD project.
		
		FreeBSD provides an excellent base technology with
		which to base products. It is a proven leader in
		performance, reliability and scalability. The
		technology also offers a very business friendly
		license that allows companies to pick and choose
		which changes they wish to contribute to the community
		rather than forcing all changes to be contributed
		back, or attaching other undesirable license
		conditions to the code.
		
		However, the FreeBSD project does not focus on
		integration of its technology into customized
		commercial products. Instead, the project focuses
		on producing a good, reliable, fast and scalable
		operating system and associated packages. The project
		maintains two lines of development. A current branch,
		where the main development of the project takes
		place, and a stable branch which is managed for
		stability and reliability. While the project maintains
		documentation on the system, including its development
		model, relatively little guidance has been given
		to companies in how to integrate FreeBSD into their
		products with a minimum of trouble.
		
		Developing a sensible strategy to deal with both
		these portions of FreeBSD requires careful planning
		and analysis. FreeBSD's lack of guidelines to
		companies leaves it up to them to develop a strategy.
		FreeBSD's development model differs from some of
		the other Free and Open Source projects. People
		familiar with those systems often discover that
		methods that were well suited to them may not work
		as well with FreeBSD's development model. These two
		issues cause many companies to make poor decisions
		without understanding the problems that lie in their
		future.
		
		Very little formal guidance exists for companies
		wishing to integrate FreeBSD into their products.
		Some email threads can be located via a Google
		search that could help companies, but many of them
		are full of contradictory information, and it is
		very disorganized. While the information about the
		FreeBSD development process is in the FreeBSD
		handbook, the implications of that process for
		companies integrating FreeBSD into their products
		are not discussed.

		PC-BSD - Making FreeBSD on the desktop a reality
		FreeBSD on the Desktop
		
		While FreeBSD is a all-around great operating system,
		it is greatly lagging behind in desktop appeal. Why
		is this? In this talk, we will take a look at some
		of the desktop drawbacks of FreeBSD, and how are
		are attempting to fix them through PC-BSD.
		
		FreeBSD has a reputation for its rock-solid
		reliability, and top-notch performance in the server
		world, but is noticeably absent when it comes to
		the vast market of desktop computing. Why is this?
		FreeBSD offers many, if not almost all of the same
		open-source packages and software that can be found
		in the more popular Linux desktop distributions,
		yet even with the speed and reliability FreeBSD
		offers, a relative few number of users are deploying
		it on their desktops.
		
		In this presentation we will take a look at some
		of the reasons why FreeBSD has not been as widely
		adopted in the desktop market as it has on the
		server side. Several of the desktop weaknesses of
		FreeBSD will be shown, along with how we are trying
		to fix these short-comings through a desktop-centric
		version of FreeBSD, known as PC-BSD. We will also
		take a look at the package management system employed
		by all open-source operating systems alike, and
		some of the pitfalls it brings, which may hinder
		widespread desktop adoption.

		Implementation of TARGET_MODE applications
		How we used TARGET_MODE in the kernel to create and
		interesting product
		
		This presentation will cover a real world implementation
		of the TARGET_MODE infrastructure in the kernel
		(stable/6). Topics to include: drivers used (isp,
		aic7xxx, firewire). scsi_target userland code vs
		kernel drivers missing drivers (4/8G isp support,
		iSCSI target)
		
		Target Mode describes a feature within certain
		drivers that allows a FreeBSD system to emulate a
		Target in the SCSI sense of the word. By recompiling
		your kernel with this feature enabled, it permits
		one to turn a FreeBSD system into an external hard
		disk. This feature of the FreeBSD kernel provides
		many interesting implementations and is highly
		desirable to many organizations whom run FreeBSD
		as their platform.
		
		I have been tasked with the maintenance of a
		proprietary target driver that interfaces with the
		FreeBSD kernel to do offsite data mirroring at the
		block level. This talk will discuss the implementation
		of that kernel mode driver and the process my
		employer went through to implement a robust and
		flexible appliance.
		
		Since I took over the implementation, we have
		implemented U160 SCSI(via aic7xxx), 2G Fibre
		Channel(via isp) and Firewire 400 (via sbp_targ).
		Each driver has it's own subtleties and requirements.
		I personally enhanced the existing Firewire target
		driver and was able to get some interesting results.
		
		I hope to demonstrate a functional Firewire 400/800
		target and show how useful this application can be
		for the embedded space. Also, I wish to demonstrate
		the need for iSCSI. USB and 4/8G Fibre Channel
		target implementations that use the TARGET_MODE
		infrastructure that is currently in place to allow
		others to expand their various interface types.
		
		The presentation should consist of a high level
		overview, followed by detailed implementation
		instructions with regards to the Firewire implementation
		and finish up with a hands-on demonstration with a
		FreeBSD PC flipped into TARGET_MODE and a Mac.

		Understanding and Tuning SCHED_ULE
		
		With the advent of widespread SMP and multicore CPU
		architectures it was necessary to implement a new
		scheduler in the FreeBSD operating system. The
		SCHEDULE scheduler was added for the 5 series of
		FreeBSD releases and has now matured to the point
		where it is the default scheduler in the 7.1 release.
		While scheduling processes was a difficult enough
		task in the uniprocessor world, moving to multiple
		processors, and multiple cores, has significantly
		increased the number of problems that await engineers
		who wish to squeeze every last ounce of performance
		out of their system. This talk will cover the basic
		design of SCHEDULE and focus a great deal of attention
		on how to tune the scheduler for different workloads,
		using the sysctl interfaces that have been provided
		for that purpose.
		
		Understanding and tuning a scheduler used to be
		done only by operating systems designers and perhaps
		a small minority of engineers focusing on esoteric
		high performance systems. With the advent of
		widespread multi-processor and multi-core architectures
		it has become necessary for more users and
		administrators to decide how to tune their systems
		for the best performance. The SCHEDULE scheduler
		in FreeBSD provides a set of sysctl interfaces for
		tuning the scheduler at run time, but in order to
		use these interfaces effectively the scheduling
		process must first be understood. This presentation
		will give an overview of how SCHEDULE works and
		then will show several examples of tuning the system
		with the interfaces provided.
		
		The goal of modifying the scheduler's parameters
		is to change the overall performance of programs
		on the system. One of the first problems presented
		to the person who wants to tune the scheduler is
		how to measure the effects of their changes. Simply
		tweaking the parameters and hoping that the tweaks will
		help is not going to lead to good results. In our
		recent experiments we have used the top(1) program
		to measure our results.

		Improving the FreeBSD TCP Implementation.
		An update on all things TCP in FreeBSD and how they

		My involvement in improving the FreeBSD TCP stack
		has continued this past year, with much of the work
		targeted at FreeBSD 8. This talk will cover what
		these changes entail, why they are of interest to
		the FreeBSD community and how they help to improve
		our TCP implementation.
		
		It has been a busy year since attending my inaugural
		BSDCan in 2008, where I talked about some of my
		work with TCP in FreeBSD.
		
		I have continued the work on TCP analysis/debugging
		tools and integrating modular congestion control
		into FreeBSD as part of the NewTCP research project.
		I will provide a progress update on this work.
		
		Additionally, a grant win from the FreeBSD Foundation
		to undertake a project titled "Improving the FreeBSD
		TCP Implementation" at Swinburne University's Centre
		for Advanced Internet Architectures has been
		progressing well. The project focuses on bringing
		TCP Appropriate Byte Counting (RFC 3465), reassembly

		Journaling FFS with WAPBL
		
		NetBSD 5 is the first NetBSD release with a journaling
		filesystem. This lecture introduces the structure
		of the Fast File System, the modifications for WAPBL
		and specific constraints of the implementation.
		
		The Fast File System (FFS) has been used in the BSD
		land for more than two decades. The original
		implementation offered two operational modes:
		
		safe and slow (sync)
		unsafe and fast (async) One decade ago, Kirk
		    McKusick introduced the soft dependency mechanism
		    to offset the performance impact without risk of
		    mortal peril on the first crash. With the advent
		    of Terabyte hard disks, the need for a file system
		    check (fsck) after a crash becomes finally unacceptable.
		    Even a background fsck like supported on FreeBSD
		    consumes lots of CPU time and IO bandwidth.
		
		
		Based on a donation from Wasabi Systems, Write Ahead
		Physical Block Logging (WAPBL) provides journaling
		for FFS with similar or better performance than
		soft dependencies during normal operation. Recovery
		time after crashes depends on the amount of outstanding
		IO operations and normally takes a few seconds.
		
		This lecture gives a short overview of FFS and the
		consistency constraints for meta data updates. It
		introduces the WAPBL changes, both in terms of the
		on-disk format and the implementation in NetBSD.
		Finally the implementation is compared to the design
		of comparable file systems and specific issues of
		and plans for the current implementation are
		discussed.

		Remote and mass management of systems with finstall
		Automated management on a largish scale
		
		An important part of the "finstall" project, created
		as a graphical installer for FreeBSD, is a configuration
		server that can be used to remotely administer and
		configure arbitrary systems. It allows for remote
		scripting of administration tasks and is flexible
		enough to support complete reconfiguration of running
		systems.
		
		The finstall project has two major parts - the
		front-end and the back-end. The front-end is just
		a GUI allowing the users to install the system in
		a convenient way. The back-end is a network-enabled
		XML-RPC server that is used by the front-end to
		perform its tasks. It can be used as a stand-alone
		configuration daemon. This talk will describe a way
		to make use of this property of finstall to remotely
		manage large groups of systems.

		good or bad will be left to human eyes.
		
		The initial version of tcpdiff presented at NYCBSDCon
		2008 demonstrated that it could be used to detect
		at least two major TCP bugs that were introduced
		into FreeBSD in the past few years. The work from
		that presentation can be viewed at
		http://www.silby.com/nycbsdcon08/.
		
		For BSDCan 2009, I hope to fix a number of bugs in
		tcpdiff, make it easier to use, set up nightly tests
		of FreeBSD, and improve it so that additional known
		bugs can be detected. Additionally, I plan to run
		it on OSes other than FreeBSD.

		Crypto Acceleration on FreeBSD
		
		As more and more services on the internet become
		cryptographically secured, the load of cryptography
		on systems becomes heavier and heavier. Crypto
		acceleration hardware is available in different
		forms for different workloads. Embedded communications
		processors from VIA and AMD have limited acceleration
		facilities in silicon and various manufacturers
		build hardware for accelerating secure web traffic
		and IPSEC VPN tunnels.
		
		This talk gives an overview of FreeBSD's crypto
		framework in the kernel and how it can be used
		together with OpenSSL to leverage acceleration
		hardware. Some numbers will be presented to demonstrate
		how acceleration can improve performance - and how
		it can curiously bring a system to a grinding halt.
		
		Philip originally started playing with crypto
		acceleration when he saw the "crypto block" in one
		of his Soekris boards. As usual, addiction was
		instant and by the grace of the "you touch it, you
		own it" principle, he has been fiddling the crypto
		framework more than is good for him.

		Firewire BoF Plugfest
		Debugging and testing of Firewire products with FreeBSD
		
		Come one come all to a Firewire plugfest. Let's
		debug and test together and see if we can't knock
		out some features and bugs.
		
		A hands-on testing and debugging session of the
		Firewire stack in FreeBSD.
		
		Everyone who wishes to attend should bring their
		Firewire devices, ext Drives and Cameras, and their
		Laptops. I will be debugging and capturing data
		points to enhance and improve features in the
		Firewire stack.
		
		We should be able to knock out quite a bunch of
		bugs if folks can bring their various Firewire
		devices along with their various PCs.
		
		Even if your Firewire device works perfectly, bring
		it by so it can be documented as supported by the
		Firewire team!

		Building the Network You Need with PF, the OpenBSD
		packet filter.
		
		Building the network you need is the central theme
		for any network admin. This tutorial is for aspiring
		or seasoned network professionals with at least a
		basic knowledge of networking in general and TCP/IP
		particular. The session aims at teaching tools and
		techniques to make sure you build your network to
		work the way it's supposed to, keeping you in charge.
		Central to the toolbox is the OpenBSD PF packet
		filter, supplemented with tools that interact with
		it. Whether you are a greybeard looking for ways
		to optimize your setups or a greenhorn just starting
		out, this session will give you valuable insight
		into the inner life of your network and provide
		pointers to how to use that knowledge to build the
		network you need. The session will also offer some
		fresh information on changes introduced in OpenBSD
		4.5, the most recent version of PF and OpenBSD. The
		tutorial is loosely based on Hansteen's recent book,
		/The Book of PF/ (No Starch Press), with updates
		and adaptations based on developments since the
		book's publication date.

		Networking from the Bottom Up: Device Drivers.
		
		In this tutorial I will describe how to write and
		maintain network drivers in FreeBSD and use the
		example of the Intel Gigabit Ethernet driver (igb)
		throughout the course.
		
		Students will learn the basic data structures and
		APIs necessary to implement a network driver in
		FreeBSD. The tutorial is general enough that it can
		be applied to other BSDs, and likely to other
		embedded and UNIX like systems while being specific
		enough that given a device and a manual the student
		should be able to develop a working driver on their
		own. This is the first of a series of lectures on
		network that I am developing over the next year or
		so.

		pfSense Tutorial
		From Zero to Hero with pfSense
		
		pfSense is a free, open source customized distribution
		of FreeBSD tailored for use as a firewall and router.
		In addition to being a powerful, flexible firewalling
		and routing platform, it includes a long list of
		related features and a package system allowing
		further expandability without adding bloat and
		potential security vulnerabilities to the base
		distribution. pfSense is a popular project with
		more than 1 million downloads since its inception,
		and proven in countless installations ranging from
		small home networks protecting a PC and an Xbox to
		large corporations, universities and other organizations
		protecting thousands of network devices.
		
		This tutorial is being presented by the founders
		of the pfSense project, Chris Buechler and Scott
		Ullrich.
		
		The session will start with an introduction to the
		project, hardware sizing and selection, installation,
		firewalling concepts and basic configuration, and
		continue to cover all the most popular features of
		the system. Common usage scenarios, deployment
		considerations, step by step configuration guidance,
		and best practices will be covered for each feature.
		Most configurations will be demonstrated in a live
		lab environment.
		
		Attendees are assumed to have basic knowledge of
		TCP/IP and firewalling concepts, however no in-depth
		knowledge in these areas or prior knowledge of
		pfSense or FreeBSD is necessary.

		FreeBSD/mips
		Embedding FreeBSD
		
		FreeBSD now runs on the MIPS platform. FreeBSD/mips
		supports MIPS-32 and MIPS-64 targets, including SMP
		for multicore support.
		
		FreeBSD/mips is targeted at the embedded MIPS
		marketplace. FreeBSD has run on the MIPS platform
		for many years. Juniper ported FreeBSD to the Mips
		platform in the late 1990's. However, concern about
		intellectual property issues kept Juniper from
		contributing the port back to FreeBSD until recently.
		The contributed port was a 64-bit mips port.
		
		In the mean time, many efforts were made to bring
		FreeBSD to the mips platform. The first substantial
		effort to bring FreeBSD to the Mips platform was
		done by Juli Mallet. This effort made it to single
		user, but never further than that. This effort was
		abandoned due to a change in Juli's life. The port
		languished.
		
		Two years ago at BSDcan, as my involvement with
		FreeBSD/arm was growing, I tried to rally the troops
		into doing a FreeBSD/mips port. My efforts resulted
		in what has been commonly called the "mips2" effort.
		The name comes from the choice of //depot/projects/mips2
		to host the work in perforce. A number of people
		worked on the earliest versions of the port, but
		it too languished and seemed destined to suffer the
		same fate as earlier efforts. Then, two individuals
		stood up and started working on the port. Wojciech
		A. Koszek and Oleksandr Tymoshenko pulled in code
		from the prior efforts. Through their efforts of
		stabilizing this code, the port to the single user
		stage and ported it to three different platforms.
		Others ported it to a few more. Snapshots of this
		work were released from time to time.
		
		Cavium Networks picked up one of these snapshots
		and ported it to their multicore mips64 network
		processor. Cavium has kindly donated much of their
		work to the comminuty.
		
		In December, I started at Cisco systems. My first
		job was to merge all the divergent variants of
		FreeBSD/mips and get it into shape to push into the
		tree. With luck, this should be in the tree before
		I give my talk.
		
		In parallel to this, other advances in the embedded
		support for FreeBSD have been happening as well.
		I'll talk about new device drivers, new subsystems,
		and new build tools that help to support the embedded
		developer.

		Building self-contained PBIs from Ports (Automagically)
		Creating a self-contained application from the ports tree
		
		PC-BSD provides a user-friendly desktop experience,
		for experts and casual users alike. PC-BSD is 100%
		FreeBSD under the hood, while providing desktop
		essentials, such as a graphical installation system,
		point-n-click package-management using the PBI
		system, and easy to use system management tools;
		All integrated into an easy to use K Desktop
		Environment (KDE).
		
		The PBI (Push Button Installer) format is the
		cornerstone of the PC-BSD desktop, which allows
		users to install applications in a self-contained
		format, free from dependency problems, and compile
		issues that stop most casual users from desktop
		adoption. The PBI format also provides power and
		flexibility in user interaction, and scripting
		support, which allows applications to be fine-tuned
		to the best possible user experience.
		
		This talk would go over in some detail our new PBI
		building system, which converts a FreeBSD port,
		such as FireFox, into a standalone self-contained
		PBI installer for PC-BSD desktops.
		
		The presentation will be divided into two main sections:
		
		The Push Button Installer (PBI) Format
		
		
		The basics of the PBI format
		The PBI format construction
		Add &amp; Remove scripting support within PBI
		
		
		Building PBIs from Ports "Auto-magically"
		
		
		The PBI build server &amp; standalone software
		Module creation &amp; configuration

		An Open Source Enterprise VPN Solution with OpenVPN and OpenBSD
		Solving the problem
		
		At Appalachian State University, we utilize an open
		source VPN to allow faculty, staff and vendors
		secure access to Appalachian State University's
		internal network from any location that has an
		Internet connection. To implement our virtual private
		network project, we needed a secure VPN that is
		flexible enough to work with our existing network
		registration and LDAP authentication systems, has
		simple client installation, is redundant, allows
		multiple VPN server instances for special site-to-site
		tunnels and unique configurations, and can run on
		multiple platforms. Using OpenVPN running on OpenBSD,
		we met those requirements and added a distributed
		administration system that allows select users to
		allow VPN access to specific computers for external
		users and vendors without requiring intervention
		from our network or security personnel. Our
		presentation will start with a quick overview of
		OpenVPN and OpenBSD and then detail the specifics
		of our VPN implementation.
		
		Dissatisfied with IPSec for road warrior VPN usage
		we went looking for a better solution. We had hopped
		that we could find a solution that would run on
		multiple platforms, was flexible and worked well.
		We found OpenVPN and have been pleased. Initially
		we ran it on RHEL. We migrated to OpenBSD for pf
		functionality and general security concerns. ...and
		because we like OpenBSD.
		
		Our presentation will focus on the specifics of our
		VPN implementation. We will quickly cover the basics
		of OpenVPN and the most used features of OpenBSD.
		Moving along we will cover multiple authentication
		methods, redundancy, running multiple instances,
		integration with our netreg system, how pf has
		extended functionality, embedding in appliances,
		and client configuration. The system has proven
		helpful with providing vendor access where needed
		and we'll cover this aspect as well. Time permitting
		we will cover current enhancement efforts and future
		plans.
		
		OpenVPN has been called the "Swiss army knife" of
		VPN solutions. We hope our presentation leaves
		participants with that feeling.

		"finstall" - the new FreeBSD installer
		A graphical installer for FreeBSD
		
		The "finstall" project, sponsored by Google as a
		Summer of Code 2007 project, is an attempt to create
		a user-friendly graphical installer for FreeBSD,
		with enough strong technical features to appeal to
		the more professional users. A long term goal for
		it is to be a replacement for sysinstall, and as
		such should support almost all of the features
		present in sysinstall, as well as add support for
		new FreeBSD features such as GEOM, ZFS, etc. This
		talk will describe the architecture of "finstall"
		and focus on its lesser known features such as
		remote installation.
		
		"finstall" is funded by Google SoC as a possible
		long-term replacement for sysinstall, as a "LiveCD"
		with the whole FreeBSD base system on the CD, with
		X11 and XFCE4 GUI. In the talk I intend to describe
		what I did so far, and what are the future plans
		for it. This includes the installer GUI, the backend
		(which has the potential to become a generic FreeBSD
		configuration backend) and the assorted tools
		developed for finstall ("LiveCD" creation scripts).
		More information on finstall can be found here:
		https://wiki.freebsd.org/finstall.

		Measured (almost) does Air Traffic Control
		Monitoring weird hardware reliably
		
		The new Danish Air Traffic Control system, CASIMO,
		prompted the development on a modular and general
		software platform for data collection, control and
		monitoring of "weird hardware" of all sorts.
		
		The talk will present the "measured" daemon, and
		detail some of the uses it has been put to, as an,
		admittedly peripheral, component of the ATC system.
		
		Many "SCADA" systems suffer from lack of usable
		interfaces for external access to the data. Measured
		takes the opposite point of view and makes real-time
		situation available, and accepts control instructions
		as ASCII text stream over TCP connections. Several
		examples of how this can be used will be demonstrated.
		
		Measured will run on any FreeBSD system, but has
		not been ported to other UNIX variants yet, and it
		is perfect for that "intelligent house" project of
		yours.
		
		I believe I gave a WIP presentation of this about
		two years ago.

		BSD licensed C++ compiler
		
		LLVM is a suite of carefully designed open source
		libraries that implement compiler components (like
		language front-ends, code generators, aggressive
		optimizers, Just-In-Time compiler support, debug
		support, link-time optimization, etc.). The goal
		of the LLVM project is to build these components
		in a way that allows them to be combined together
		to create familiar tools (like a C compiler),
		interesting new tools (like an OpenGL JIT compiler),
		and many other things we haven't thought of yet.
		Because LLVM is under continuous development, clients
		of these components naturally benefit from improvements
		in the libraries.
		
		This talk gives an overview of LLVM's design and
		approach to compiler construction, and gives several
		example applications. It describes applications of
		LLVM technology to llvm-gcc (a C/C++/Objective C
		compiler based on the GNU GCC front-end), the OpenGL
		stack in Mac OS/X Leopard, and Clang. Among other
		things, the Clang+LLVM Compiler provides a fully
		BSD-Licensed C and Objective-C compiler (with C++
		in development) which compiles code several times
		faster than GCC, produces code that is faster than
		GCC in many cases, produces better warnings and
		error messages, and supports many other applications
		(e.g. static analysis and refactoring).

		simple administration, transactional semantics, end-to-end data integrity
		
		SUN's ZFS file system became part of FreeBSD on 6th
		April 2007. ZFS is a new kind of file system that
		provides simple administration, transactional
		semantics, end-to-end data integrity, and immense
		scalability. ZFS is not an incremental improvement
		to existing technology; it is a fundamentally new
		approach to data management. We've blown away 20
		years of obsolete assumptions, eliminated complexity
		at the source, and created a storage system that's
		actually a pleasure to use.
		
		ZFS presents a pooled storage model that completely
		eliminates the concept of volumes and the associated
		problems of partitions, provisioning, wasted bandwidth
		and stranded storage. Thousands of file systems can
		draw from a common storage pool, each one consuming
		only as much space as it actually needs. The combined
		I/O bandwidth of all devices in the pool is available
		to all filesystems at all times.
		
		All operations are copy-on-write transactions, so
		the on-disk state is always valid. There is no need
		to fsck(1M) a ZFS file system, ever. Every block
		is checksummed to prevent silent data corruption,
		and the data is self-healing in replicated (mirrored
		or RAID) configurations. If one copy is damaged,
		ZFS detects it and uses another copy to repair it.

		Interfacing embedded FreeBSD with U-Boot
		Working with the de facto standard for an initial level boot loader
		
		In the embedded world U-Boot is a de facto standard
		for an initial level boot loader (firmware). It
		runs on a great number of platforms and architectures,
		and is open source.
		
		This talk covers the development work on integrating
		FreeBSD with U-Boot-based systems. Starting with
		an overview of differences between booting an
		all-purpose desktop computer vs. embedded system,
		FreeBSD booting concepts are explained along with
		requirements for the underlying firmware.
		
		Historical attempts to interface FreeBSD with this
		firmware are mentioned and explanation given on why
		they failed or proved incomplete. Finally, the
		recently developed approach to integrate FreeBSD
		and U-Boot is presented, with implementation details
		and particular attention on how it's been made
		architecture and platform independent, and how
		loader(8) has been bound to it.

		Introduction to Debugging the FreeBSD Kernel
		
		Just like every other piece of software, the FreeBSD
		kernel has bugs. Debugging a kernel is a bit different
		from debugging a userland program as there is nothing
		underneath the kernel to provide debugging facilities
		such as ptrace() or procfs. This paper will give a
		brief overview of some of the tools available for
		investigating bugs in the FreeBSD kernel. It will
		cover the in-kernel debugger DDB and the external
		debugger kgdb which is used to perform post-mortem
		analysis on kernel crash dumps.
		
		Introduction to Debugging the FreeBSD Kernel
		
		Basic crash messages, what a crash looks like
		    
		    typical panic() invocation
		    page fault example
		    
		"live" debugging with DDB
		    
		    stack traces
		    ps
		    deadlock examples
		    show lockchain
		    show sleepchain
		    Adding new DDB commands
		    
		KGDB
		    
		    inspecting processes and threads
		    working with kernel modules
		    using scripts to extend
		    
		examining crashdumps using utilities
		    
		    ps, netstat, etc.
		    
		debugging strategies
		    
		    kernel crashes
		    system hangs

		DTrace for FreeBSD
		What on earth is that system doing?!
		
		DTrace is a comprehensive dynamic tracing facility
		originally developed for Solaris that can be used
		by administrators and developers on live production
		systems to examine the behavior of both user programs
		and of the operating system itself. DTrace enables
		users to explore their system to understand how it
		works, track down performance problems across many
		layers of software, or locate the cause of aberrant
		behavior. DTrace lets users create their own custom
		programs to dynamically instrument the system and
		provide immediate, concise answers to arbitrary
		questions you can formulate using the DTrace D
		programming language.
		
		This talk discusses the port of the DTrace facility
		to FreeBSD and demonstrates examples on a live
		FreeBSD system.
		
		
		Introduction to the D language - probes, predicates and actions.
		dtrace(8) and libdtrace - the userland side of the DTrace story.
		The DTrace kernel module, it's ioctl interface to userland and the provider infrastructure in the kernel.
		DTrace kernel hooks and the problem of code licensed under Sun's CDDL.
		What does a DTrace probe actually do?
		DTrace safety and how it is implemented.
		Build system changes to add CTF (Compact C Type Format) data to objects, shared libraries and executables.
		The DTrace test suite.
		A brief list of things to do to port the DTrace facility to other BSD-derived operating systems.

		What Not To Do When Writing Network Applications
		The lessons learnt working with not-so-high-performance network applications
		
		This talk will look at issues which face the modern
		network application developer, from the point of
		view of poorly-designed examples. This will cover
		internal code structure and dataflow, interaction
		with the TCP stack, IO scheduling in high and low
		latency environments and high-availability
		considerations. In essence, this presentation should
		be seen as a checklist of what not to do when writing
		network applications.
		
		Plenty of examples of well designed network
		applications exist in the open and closed source
		world today. Unfortunately there are just as many
		examples of fast network applications as there are
		"fast but workload specific"; sometimes failing
		miserably in handling the general case. This may
		be due to explicit design (eg Varnish) but many are
		simply due to the designer not fully appreciating
		the wide variance in "networks" - and their network
		application degrades ungracefully when under duress.
		My aim in this presentation is to touch on a wide
		number of issues which face network application
		programmers - most of which seem not "application
		related" to the newcomer - such as including
		pipelining into network communication, managing a
		balance between accepting new requests and servicing
		existing requests, or providing back-pressure to a
		L4 loadbalancer in case of traffic bursts. Various
		schemes for working with these issues will be
		presented, and hopefully participants will walk
		away with more of an understanding about how the
		network, application and operating systems interact.

		Using FreeBSD to Promote Open Source Development Methods
		
		In this talk we present Aerosource, an initiative
		to bring Open Source Software development methods
		to internal software developers at The Aerospace
		Corporation.
		
		Within Aerosource, FreeBSD is used in several key
		roles. First, we run most of our tools on top of
		FreeBSD. Second, the ports collection (both official
		ports and custom internal ones) eases our administrative
		burden. Third, the FreeBSD project serves as an
		example and role model for the results that can be
		achieved by an Open Source Software projects. We
		discuss the development infrastructure we have built
		for Aerosource based largely on BSD licensed software
		including FreeBSD, PostgreSQL, Apache, and Trac.
		We will also discuss our custom management tools
		including our system for managing our custom internal
		ports. Finally, we will cover our development
		successes and how we use projects like FreeBSD as
		exemplars of OSS development.

		Porting FreeBSD/ARM to Marvell Orion System-On-Chip
		
		This talk covers the development work on porting
		the FreeBSD/ARM to Marvell Orion family of highly
		integrated chips.
		
		ARM architecture is widely adopted in the embedded
		devices, and since the architecture can be licensed,
		many implementation variations exist: Orion is a
		derivative compliant with the ARMv5TE definition,
		it provides a rich set of on-chip peripherals.
		
		Present state of the FreeBSD support for ARM is
		explained, areas for improvement highlighted and
		its overall shape and condition presented.
		
		The main discussion covers scope of the Orion port
		(what integrated peripherals required new development,
		what was adapted from existing code base); design
		decisions are explained for the most critical items,
		and implementation details revealed.
		
		Summary notes are given on general porting methodology,
		debugging techniques and difficulties encountered
		during such undertaking.

		Recently I have been attending Hostobzor 12th, the
		Russian conference of hosting providers, beeing
		held at Raivola hotel near St. Petersburg. The event
		was great as always thanks to organizers. There was
		a number of intersting talks given, a lot of
		interesting discussions held, and, what I appreciate
		better, a lot of new people with great ideas met.
		
		I gave a talk on using the FreeBSD Ports system to
		mange a large-scale virtual hosting installations
		based on Hosting Telesystems experience. I tried
		to describe in detail how we use the ports collection
		to deploy a large number of servers diverced by
		architecture and OS versions, how we build packages
		and distribute them among servers, talked about how
		we use Mercurial VCS to incrementally merge upstream
		changes into our modified ports collection and
		FreeBSD src trees. Hopefully, I've not screwed it
		much... At least, some people was interested a lot
		and asked interesting questions.

		In 2004 ben ik begonnen met het FreeBSD Dutch
		Documentation Project, een project dat inmiddels
		bijna het complete handboek vertaald heeft. Sinds
		die tijd zijn er vele wegen geweest die ik behandeld
		heb, van documentatie projectleider naar Security
		Team-lid tot aan FreeBSD Developer.
		
		Remko Lodder is momenteel 25 jaar en werkt als Unix
		Engineer voor het bedrijf Snow B.V. waar hij zich
		momenteel met name bezig houd met security (firewalls
		etc). Hij is sinds 2004 lid van het FreeBSD Development
		team en is momenteel 1 van de meest actieve developers
		binnen het team.

		Hans zal een historisch overzicht geven van het
		ontstaan van *BSD vanaf de oorsprong van UNIX tot
		aan de nu bekende *BSD varianten. Hij zal daarbij
		met name ingaan wat de oorsprong en het ontstaan
		van een aantal *BSD-projecten zijn. Hierbij zal hij
		zeer kort ingaan op de verschillende licentieproblemen
		die we in het verleden gezien hebben en worden een
		aantal bekende personen en data weer eens even op
		de kaart geplaatst.
		
		Hans van de Looy is oprichter van Madison Gurkha. Een bedrijf
		dat gespecialiseerd is op het gebied van het uitvoeren
		van technische ICT-beveiligingsonderzoeken, in de
		media ook wel aangeduid met Etisch Hacken. Tijdens
		dergelijke onderzoeken maakt hij ook regelmatig
		gebruik van op BSD* gebaseerde systemen.

		In April 2009 I was invited to speak on FreeBSD/PmcTools
		by the Bangalore chapter of the ACM.
		
		This was an overview talk. The talk briefly touched
		upon: the motivations and goals of the project, the
		programming APIs, some aspects of the implementation
		and on possible future work.

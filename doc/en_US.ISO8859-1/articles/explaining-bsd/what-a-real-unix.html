      derivatives of AT&amp;T's Research <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® operating system,
      which is also the ancestor of the modern <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® System V.  This
      may surprise you.  How could that happen when AT&amp;T has never
      released its code as open source?</p><p>It is true that AT&amp;T <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® is not open source, and in a
      copyright sense BSD is very definitely <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>®, but on the other hand, AT&amp;T has imported sources
      from other projects, noticeably the Computer Sciences Research
      Group (CSRG) of the University of California in Berkeley, CA.
      Starting in 1976, the CSRG started releasing tapes of their
      software, calling them <span class="emphasis"><em>Berkeley Software
	Distribution</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>BSD</em></span>.</p><p>Initial BSD releases consisted mainly of user programs, but
      that changed dramatically when the CSRG landed a contract with
      the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to upgrade
      the communications protocols on their network, ARPANET.  The new
      protocols were known as the <span class="emphasis"><em>Internet
	Protocols</em></span>, later <span class="emphasis"><em>TCP/IP</em></span> after
      the most important protocols.  The first widely distributed
      implementation was part of 4.2BSD, in 1982.</p><p>In the course of the 1980s, a number of new workstation
      companies sprang up.  Many preferred to license <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® rather
      than developing operating systems for themselves.  In
      particular, Sun Microsystems licensed <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® and implemented a
      version of 4.2BSD, which they called <span class="trademark">SunOS</span>&#8482;.  When AT&amp;T
      themselves were allowed to sell <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® commercially, they
      started with a somewhat bare-bones implementation called System
      III, to be quickly followed by System V.  The System V code base
      did not include networking, so all implementations included
      additional software from the BSD, including the TCP/IP software,
      but also utilities such as the <span class="emphasis"><em>csh</em></span> shell
      and the <span class="emphasis"><em>vi</em></span> editor.  Collectively, these
      enhancements were known as the <span class="emphasis"><em>Berkeley
	Extensions</em></span>.</p><p>The BSD tapes contained AT&amp;T source code and thus
      required a <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® source license.  By 1990, the CSRG's funding
      was running out, and it faced closure.  Some members of the
      group decided to release the BSD code, which was Open Source,
      without the AT&amp;T proprietary code.  This finally happened
      with the <span class="emphasis"><em>Networking Tape 2</em></span>, usually known
      as <span class="emphasis"><em>Net/2</em></span>.  Net/2 was not a complete
      operating system: about 20% of the kernel code was missing.  One
      of the CSRG members, William F. Jolitz, wrote the remaining code
      and released it in early 1992 as <span class="emphasis"><em>386BSD</em></span>.
      At the same time, another group of ex-CSRG members formed a
      commercial company called <a class="link" href="http://www.bsdi.com/" target="_top">Berkeley Software Design
	Inc.</a> and released a beta version of an operating system
      called <a class="link" href="http://www.bsdi.com/" target="_top">BSD/386</a>,
      which was based on the same sources.  The name of the operating
      system was later changed to BSD/OS.</p><p>386BSD never became a stable operating system.  Instead, two
      other projects split off from it in 1993: <a class="link" href="http://www.NetBSD.org/" target="_top">NetBSD</a> and <a class="link" href="../../../../index.html" target="_top">FreeBSD</a>.  The two
      projects originally diverged due to differences in patience
      waiting for improvements to 386BSD: the NetBSD people started
      early in the year, and the first version of FreeBSD was not
      ready until the end of the year.  In the meantime, the code base
      had diverged sufficiently to make it difficult to merge.  In
      addition, the projects had different aims, as we will see below.
      In 1996, <a class="link" href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/" target="_top">OpenBSD</a> split off
      from NetBSD, and in 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.dragonflybsd.org/" target="_top">DragonFlyBSD</a>
      split off from FreeBSD.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="why-is-bsd-not-better-known.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Explaining BSD </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. Why is BSD not better known?</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

      and FreeBSD?  For the average user, the difference is
      surprisingly small: Both are <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® like operating systems.
      Both are developed by non-commercial projects (this does not
      apply to many other Linux distributions, of course).  In the
      following section, we will look at BSD and compare it to Linux.
      The description applies most closely to FreeBSD, which accounts
      for an estimated 80% of the BSD installations, but the
      differences from NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFlyBSD are
      small.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp46949752"></a>4.1. Who owns BSD?</h3></div></div></div><p>No one person or corporation owns BSD. It is created and
	distributed by a community of highly technical and committed
	contributors all over the world.  Some of the components of
	BSD are Open Source projects in their own right and managed by
	different project maintainers.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp46953080"></a>4.2. How is BSD developed and updated?</h3></div></div></div><p>The BSD kernels are developed and updated following the
	Open Source development model.  Each project maintains a
	publicly accessible <span class="emphasis"><em>source tree</em></span> which
	contains all source files for the project, including
	documentation and other incidental files.  Users can obtain a
	complete copy of any version.</p><p>A large number of developers worldwide contribute to
	improvements to BSD.  They are divided into three
	kinds:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><em class="firstterm">Contributors</em> write code or
	    documentation.  They are not permitted to commit (add
	    code) directly to the source tree.  In order for their
	    code to be included in the system, it must be reviewed and
	    checked in by a registered developer, known as a
	    <span class="emphasis"><em>committer</em></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><em class="firstterm">Committers</em> are developers with
	    write access to the source tree.  In order to become a
	    committer, an individual must show ability in the area in
	    which they are active.</p><p>It is at the individual committer's discretion whether
	    they should obtain authority before committing changes to
	    the source tree.  In general, an experienced committer may
	    make changes which are obviously correct without obtaining
	    consensus.  For example, a documentation project committer
	    may correct typographical or grammatical errors without
	    review.  On the other hand, developers making far-reaching
	    or complicated changes are expected to submit their
	    changes for review before committing them.  In extreme
	    cases, a core team member with a function such as
	    Principal Architect may order that changes be removed from
	    the tree, a process known as <em class="firstterm">backing
	      out</em>.  All committers receive mail describing
	    each individual commit, so it is not possible to commit
	    secretly.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <em class="firstterm">Core team</em>.  FreeBSD and
	    NetBSD each have a core team which manages the project.
	    The core teams developed in the course of the projects,
	    and their role is not always well-defined.  It is not
	    necessary to be a developer in order to be a core team
	    member, though it is normal.  The rules for the core team
	    vary from one project to the other, but in general they
	    have more say in the direction of the project than
	    non-core team members have.</p></li></ul></div><p>This arrangement differs from Linux in a number of
	ways:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>No one person controls the content of the system.  In
	    practice, this difference is overrated, since the
	    Principal Architect can require that code be backed out,
	    and even in the Linux project several people are permitted
	    to make changes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>On the other hand, there <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a
	    central repository, a single place where you can find the
	    entire operating system sources, including all older
	    versions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>BSD projects maintain the entire <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Operating
	      System</span>&#8221;</span>, not only the kernel.  This distinction
	    is only marginally useful: neither BSD nor Linux is useful
	    without applications.  The applications used under BSD are
	    frequently the same as the applications used under
	    Linux.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As a result of the formalized maintenance of a single
	    SVN source tree, BSD development is clear, and it is
	    possible to access any version of the system by release
	    number or by date.  SVN also allows incremental updates to
	    the system: for example, the FreeBSD repository is updated
	    about 100 times a day.  Most of these changes are
	    small.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp46983416"></a>4.3. BSD releases</h3></div></div></div><p>FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD provide the system in three
	different <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">releases</span>&#8221;</span>.  As with Linux, releases
	are assigned a number such as 1.4.1 or 3.5.  In addition, the
	version number has a suffix indicating its purpose:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>The development version of the system is called
	    <em class="firstterm">CURRENT</em>.  FreeBSD assigns a number
	    to CURRENT, for example FreeBSD 5.0-CURRENT.  NetBSD uses
	    a slightly different naming scheme and appends a
	    single-letter suffix which indicates changes in the
	    internal interfaces, for example NetBSD 1.4.3G.  OpenBSD
	    does not assign a number (<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">OpenBSD-current</span>&#8221;</span>).
	    All new development on the system goes into this
	    branch.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At regular intervals, between two and four times a
	    year, the projects bring out a
	    <em class="firstterm">RELEASE</em> version of the system,
	    which is available on CD-ROM and for free download from
	    FTP sites, for example OpenBSD 2.6-RELEASE or NetBSD
	    1.4-RELEASE.  The RELEASE version is intended for end
	    users and is the normal version of the system.  NetBSD
	    also provides <span class="emphasis"><em>patch releases</em></span> with a
	    third digit, for example NetBSD 1.4.2.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As bugs are found in a RELEASE version, they are
	    fixed, and the fixes are added to the SVN tree.  In
	    FreeBSD, the resultant version is called the
	    <em class="firstterm">STABLE</em> version, while in NetBSD and
	    OpenBSD it continues to be called the RELEASE version.
	    Smaller new features can also be added to this branch
	    after a period of test in the CURRENT branch.  Security
	    and other important bug fixes are also applied to all
	    supported RELEASE versions.</p></li></ol></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>By contrast, Linux maintains two separate code
	  trees: the stable version and the development version.
	  Stable versions have an even minor version number, such as
	  2.0, 2.2 or 2.4.  Development versions have an odd minor
	  version number, such as 2.1, 2.3 or 2.5.  In each case, the
	  number is followed by a further number designating the exact
	  release.  In addition, each vendor adds their own userland
	  programs and utilities, so the name of the distribution is
	  also important.  Each distribution vendor also assigns
	  version numbers to the distribution, so a complete
	  description might be something like <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">TurboLinux 6.0
	    with kernel 2.2.14</span>&#8221;</span></em></span></p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp47013240"></a>4.4. What versions of BSD are available?</h3></div></div></div><p>In contrast to the numerous Linux distributions, there are
	only four major open source BSDs.  Each BSD project maintains
	its own source tree and its own kernel.  In practice, though,
	there appear to be fewer divergences between the userland code
	of the projects than there is in Linux.</p><p>It is difficult to categorize the goals of each project:
	the differences are very subjective.  Basically,</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>FreeBSD aims for high performance and ease of use by end
	    users, and is a favourite of web content providers.  It

	    SMP-capable infrastructure that is easy to understand,
	    maintain and develop for.</p></li></ul></div><p>There are also two additional BSD <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® operating systems
	which are not open source, BSD/OS and Apple's <span class="trademark">Mac OS</span>®
	X:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>BSD/OS was the oldest of the 4.4BSD derivatives.  It

	    available at relatively low cost.  It resembled FreeBSD in
	    many ways.  Two years after the acquisition of BSDi by
	    Wind River Systems, BSD/OS failed to survive as an
	    independent product.  Support and source code may still be
	    available from Wind River, but all new development is

	license?</h3></div></div></div><p>Linux is available under the <a class="link" href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top">GNU
	  General Public License</a> (GPL), which is designed to
	eliminate closed source software.  In particular, any
	derivative work of a product released under the GPL must also
	be supplied with source code if requested.  By contrast, the
	<a class="link" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html" target="_top">BSD
	  license</a> is less restrictive: binary-only
	distributions are allowed.  This is particularly attractive
	for embedded applications.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp47071608"></a>4.6. What else should I know?</h3></div></div></div><p>Since fewer applications are available for BSD than Linux,
	the BSD developers created a Linux compatibility package,
	which allows Linux programs to run under BSD.  The package
	includes both kernel modifications, in order to correctly
	perform Linux system calls, and Linux compatibility files such
	as the C library.  There is no noticeable difference in
	execution speed between a Linux application running on a Linux
	machine and a Linux application running on a BSD machine of
	the same speed.</p><p>The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">all from one supplier</span>&#8221;</span> nature of BSD
	means that upgrades are much easier to handle than is
	frequently the case with Linux.  BSD handles library version
	upgrades by providing compatibility modules for earlier
	library versions, so it is possible to run binaries which are
	several years old with no problems.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp47076600"></a>4.7. Which should I use, BSD or Linux?</h3></div></div></div><p>What does this all mean in practice?  Who should use BSD,
	who should use Linux?</p><p>This is a very difficult question to answer.  Here are

	    change.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>BSD systems, in particular FreeBSD, can have notably
	    higher performance than Linux.  But this is not across the

	    FreeBSD.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In general, BSD systems have a better reputation for

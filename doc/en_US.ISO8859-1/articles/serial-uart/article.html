	controller is the key component of the serial communications
	subsystem of a computer.  The UART takes bytes of data and
	transmits the individual bits in a sequential fashion.  At the
	destination, a second UART re-assembles the bits into complete
	bytes.</p><p>Serial transmission is commonly used with modems and for
	non-networked communication between computers, terminals and
	other devices.</p><p>There are two primary forms of serial transmission:
	Synchronous and Asynchronous.  Depending on the modes that are
	supported by the hardware, the name of the communication
	sub-system will usually include a <code class="literal">A</code> if it
	supports Asynchronous communications, and a
	<code class="literal">S</code> if it supports Synchronous
	communications.  Both forms are described below.</p><p>Some common acronyms are:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>UART Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>USART Universal Synchronous-Asynchronous
	  Receiver/Transmitter</p></blockquote></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45018488"></a>1.1. Synchronous Serial Transmission</h3></div></div></div><p>Synchronous serial transmission requires that the sender
	  and receiver share a clock with one another, or that the
	  sender provide a strobe or other timing signal so that the
	  receiver knows when to <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">read</span>&#8221;</span> the next bit of
	  the data.  In most forms of serial Synchronous
	  communication, if there is no data available at a given
	  instant to transmit, a fill character must be sent instead
	  so that data is always being transmitted.  Synchronous
	  communication is usually more efficient because only data
	  bits are transmitted between sender and receiver, and
	  synchronous communication can be more costly if extra wiring
	  and circuits are required to share a clock signal between
	  the sender and receiver.</p><p>A form of Synchronous transmission is used with printers
	  and fixed disk devices in that the data is sent on one set
	  of wires while a clock or strobe is sent on a different
	  wire. Printers and fixed disk devices are not normally
	  serial devices because most fixed disk interface standards
	  send an entire word of data for each clock or strobe signal
	  by using a separate wire for each bit of the word.  In the
	  PC industry, these are known as Parallel devices.</p><p>The standard serial communications hardware in the PC
	  does not support Synchronous operations.  This mode is
	  described here for comparison purposes only.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45024248"></a>1.2. Asynchronous Serial Transmission</h3></div></div></div><p>Asynchronous transmission allows data to be transmitted
	  without the sender having to send a clock signal to the
	  receiver.  Instead, the sender and receiver must agree on
	  timing parameters in advance and special bits are added to
	  each word which are used to synchronize the sending and
	  receiving units.</p><p>When a word is given to the UART for Asynchronous
	  transmissions, a bit called the "Start Bit" is added to the
	  beginning of each word that is to be transmitted.  The Start
	  Bit is used to alert the receiver that a word of data is
	  about to be sent, and to force the clock in the receiver
	  into synchronization with the clock in the transmitter.
	  These two clocks must be accurate enough to not have the
	  frequency drift by more than 10% during the transmission of
	  the remaining bits in the word.  (This requirement was set
	  in the days of mechanical teleprinters and is easily met by
	  modern electronic equipment.)</p><p>After the Start Bit, the individual bits of the word of
	  data are sent, with the Least Significant Bit (LSB) being
	  sent first.  Each bit in the transmission is transmitted for
	  exactly the same amount of time as all of the other bits,
	  and the receiver <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">looks</span>&#8221;</span> at the wire at
	  approximately halfway through the period assigned to each
	  bit to determine if the bit is a <code class="literal">1</code> or a
	  <code class="literal">0</code>.  For example, if it takes two seconds
	  to send each bit, the receiver will examine the signal to
	  determine if it is a <code class="literal">1</code> or a
	  <code class="literal">0</code> after one second has passed, then it
	  will wait two seconds and then examine the value of the next
	  bit, and so on.</p><p>The sender does not know when the receiver has
	  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">looked</span>&#8221;</span> at the value of the bit.  The sender
	  only knows when the clock says to begin transmitting the
	  next bit of the word.</p><p>When the entire data word has been sent, the transmitter
	  may add a Parity Bit that the transmitter generates.  The
	  Parity Bit may be used by the receiver to perform simple
	  error checking.  Then at least one Stop Bit is sent by the
	  transmitter.</p><p>When the receiver has received all of the bits in the
	  data word, it may check for the Parity Bits (both sender and
	  receiver must agree on whether a Parity Bit is to be used),
	  and then the receiver looks for a Stop Bit.  If the Stop Bit
	  does not appear when it is supposed to, the UART considers
	  the entire word to be garbled and will report a Framing
	  Error to the host processor when the data word is read.  The
	  usual cause of a Framing Error is that the sender and
	  receiver clocks were not running at the same speed, or that
	  the signal was interrupted.</p><p>Regardless of whether the data was received correctly or
	  not, the UART automatically discards the Start, Parity and
	  Stop bits.  If the sender and receiver are configured
	  identically, these bits are not passed to the host.</p><p>If another word is ready for transmission, the Start Bit
	  for the new word can be sent as soon as the Stop Bit for the
	  previous word has been sent.</p><p>Because asynchronous data is <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">self
	  synchronizing</span>&#8221;</span>, if there is no data to transmit, the
	  transmission line can be idle.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45045752"></a>1.3. Other UART Functions</h3></div></div></div><p>In addition to the basic job of converting data from
	  parallel to serial for transmission and from serial to
	  parallel on reception, a UART will usually provide
	  additional circuits for signals that can be used to indicate
	  the state of the transmission media, and to regulate the
	  flow of data in the event that the remote device is not
	  prepared to accept more data.  For example, when the device
	  connected to the UART is a modem, the modem may report the
	  presence of a carrier on the phone line while the computer
	  may be able to instruct the modem to reset itself or to not
	  take calls by raising or lowering one more of these
	  extra signals. The function of each of these additional
	  signals is defined in the EIA RS232-C standard.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45048568"></a>1.4. The RS232-C and V.24 Standards</h3></div></div></div><p>In most computer systems, the UART is connected to
	  circuitry that generates signals that comply with the EIA
	  RS232-C specification.  There is also a CCITT standard named
	  V.24 that mirrors the specifications included in
	  RS232-C.</p><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45051128"></a>1.4.1. RS232-C Bit Assignments (Marks and Spaces)</h4></div></div></div><p>In RS232-C, a value of <code class="literal">1</code> is called
	    a <code class="literal">Mark</code> and a value of
	    <code class="literal">0</code> is called a <code class="literal">Space</code>.
	    When a communication line is idle, the line is said to be
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Marking</span>&#8221;</span>, or transmitting continuous
	    <code class="literal">1</code> values.</p><p>The Start bit always has a value of
	    <code class="literal">0</code> (a Space).  The Stop Bit always has a
	    value of <code class="literal">1</code> (a Mark).  This means that
	    there will always be a Mark (1) to Space (0) transition on
	    the line at the start of every word, even when multiple
	    word are transmitted back to back.  This guarantees that
	    sender and receiver can resynchronize their clocks
	    regardless of the content of the data bits that are being
	    transmitted.</p><p>The idle time between Stop and Start bits does not
	    have to be an exact multiple (including zero) of the bit
	    rate of the communication link, but most UARTs are
	    designed this way for simplicity.</p><p>In RS232-C, the "Marking" signal (a
	    <code class="literal">1</code>) is represented by a voltage between
	    -2 VDC and -12 VDC, and a "Spacing" signal (a
	    <code class="literal">0</code>) is represented by a voltage between
	    0 and +12 VDC.  The transmitter is supposed to send +12
	    VDC or -12 VDC, and the receiver is supposed to allow for
	    some voltage loss in long cables.  Some transmitters in
	    low power devices (like portable computers) sometimes use
	    only +5 VDC and -5 VDC, but these values are still
	    acceptable to a RS232-C receiver, provided that the cable
	    lengths are short.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45079928"></a>1.4.2. RS232-C Break Signal</h4></div></div></div><p>RS232-C also specifies a signal called a
	    <code class="literal">Break</code>, which is caused by sending
	    continuous Spacing values (no Start or Stop bits).  When
	    there is no electricity present on the data circuit, the
	    line is considered to be sending
	    <code class="literal">Break</code>.</p><p>The <code class="literal">Break</code> signal must be of a
	    duration longer than the time it takes to send a complete
	    byte plus Start, Stop and Parity bits.  Most UARTs can
	    distinguish between a Framing Error and a Break, but if
	    the UART cannot do this, the Framing Error detection can
	    be used to identify Breaks.</p><p>In the days of teleprinters, when numerous printers
	    around the country were wired in series (such as news
	    services), any unit could cause a <code class="literal">Break</code>
	    by temporarily opening the entire circuit so that no
	    current flowed.  This was used to allow a location with
	    urgent news to interrupt some other location that was
	    currently sending information.</p><p>In modern systems there are two types of Break
	    signals. If the Break is longer than 1.6 seconds, it is
	    considered a "Modem Break", and some modems can be
	    programmed to terminate the conversation and go on-hook or
	    enter the modems' command mode when the modem detects this
	    signal.  If the Break is smaller than 1.6 seconds, it
	    signifies a Data Break and it is up to the remote computer
	    to respond to this signal.  Sometimes this form of Break
	    is used as an Attention or Interrupt signal and sometimes
	    is accepted as a substitute for the ASCII CONTROL-C
	    character.</p><p>Marks and Spaces are also equivalent to
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Holes</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">No Holes</span>&#8221;</span> in paper
	    tape systems.</p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breaks cannot be generated from paper tape or from
	      any other byte value, since bytes are always sent with
	      Start and Stop bit.  The UART is usually capable of
	      generating the continuous Spacing signal in response to
	      a special command from the host processor.</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45093496"></a>1.4.3. RS232-C DTE and DCE Devices</h4></div></div></div><p>The RS232-C specification defines two types of
	    equipment: the Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and the Data
	    Carrier Equipment (DCE).  Usually, the DTE device is the
	    terminal (or computer), and the DCE is a modem.  Across
	    the phone line at the other end of a conversation, the
	    receiving modem is also a DCE device and the computer that
	    is connected to that modem is a DTE device.  The DCE
	    device receives signals on the pins that the DTE device
	    transmits on, and vice versa.</p><p>When two devices that are both DTE or both DCE must be
	    connected together without a modem or a similar media
	    translator between them, a NULL modem must be used.  The
	    NULL modem electrically re-arranges the cabling so that
	    the transmitter output is connected to the receiver input
	    on the other device, and vice versa.  Similar translations
	    are performed on all of the control signals so that each
	    device will see what it thinks are DCE (or DTE) signals
	    from the other device.</p><p>The number of signals generated by the DTE and DCE
	    devices are not symmetrical.  The DTE device generates
	    fewer signals for the DCE device than the DTE device
	    receives from the DCE.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45097592"></a>1.4.4. RS232-C Pin Assignments</h4></div></div></div><p>The EIA RS232-C specification (and the ITU equivalent,
	    V.24) calls for a twenty-five pin connector (usually a
	    DB25) and defines the purpose of most of the pins in that
	    connector.</p><p>In the IBM Personal Computer and similar systems, a
	    subset of RS232-C signals are provided via nine pin
	    connectors (DB9).  The signals that are not included on
	    the PC connector deal mainly with synchronous operation,
	    and this transmission mode is not supported by the UART
	    that IBM selected for use in the IBM PC.</p><p>Depending on the computer manufacturer, a DB25, a DB9,
	    or both types of connector may be used for RS232-C
	    communications.  (The IBM PC also uses a DB25 connector
	    for the parallel printer interface which causes some
	    confusion.)</p><p>Below is a table of the RS232-C signal assignments in

	  asynchronous communication.  Because of advances in modem
	  communication technology, this term is frequently misused
	  when describing the data rates in newer devices.</p><p>Traditionally, a Baud Rate represents the number of bits
	  that are actually being sent over the media, not the amount
	  of data that is actually moved from one DTE device to the
	  other. The Baud count includes the overhead bits Start, Stop
	  and Parity that are generated by the sending UART and
	  removed by the receiving UART.  This means that seven-bit
	  words of data actually take 10 bits to be completely
	  transmitted.  Therefore, a modem capable of moving 300 bits
	  per second from one place to another can normally only move
	  30 7-bit words if Parity is used and one Start and Stop bit
	  are present.</p><p>If 8-bit data words are used and Parity bits are also
	  used, the data rate falls to 27.27 words per second, because
	  it now takes 11 bits to send the eight-bit words, and the
	  modem still only sends 300 bits per second.</p><p>The formula for converting bytes per second into a baud
	  rate and vice versa was simple until error-correcting modems
	  came along.  These modems receive the serial stream of bits
	  from the UART in the host computer (even when internal
	  modems are used the data is still frequently serialized) and
	  converts the bits back into bytes.  These bytes are then
	  combined into packets and sent over the phone line using a
	  Synchronous transmission method.  This means that the Stop,
	  Start, and Parity bits added by the UART in the DTE (the
	  computer) were removed by the modem before transmission by
	  the sending modem. When these bytes are received by the
	  remote modem, the remote modem adds Start, Stop and Parity
	  bits to the words, converts them to a serial format and then
	  sends them to the receiving UART in the remote computer, who
	  then strips the Start, Stop and Parity bits.</p><p>The reason all these extra conversions are done is so
	  that the two modems can perform error correction, which
	  means that the receiving modem is able to ask the sending
	  modem to resend a block of data that was not received with
	  the correct checksum.  This checking is handled by the
	  modems, and the DTE devices are usually unaware that the
	  process is occurring.</p><p>By striping the Start, Stop and Parity bits, the
	  additional bits of data that the two modems must share
	  between themselves to perform error-correction are mostly
	  concealed from the effective transmission rate seen by the
	  sending and receiving DTE equipment.  For example, if a
	  modem sends ten 7-bit words to another modem without
	  including the Start, Stop and Parity bits, the sending modem
	  will be able to add 30 bits of its own information that the
	  receiving modem can use to do error-correction without
	  impacting the transmission speed of the real data.</p><p>The use of the term Baud is further confused by modems
	  that perform compression.  A single 8-bit word passed over
	  the telephone line might represent a dozen words that were
	  transmitted to the sending modem.  The receiving modem will
	  expand the data back to its original content and pass that
	  data to the receiving DTE.</p><p>Modern modems also include buffers that allow the rate
	  that bits move across the phone line (DCE to DCE) to be a
	  different speed than the speed that the bits move between
	  the DTE and DCE on both ends of the conversation.  Normally
	  the speed between the DTE and DCE is higher than the DCE to
	  DCE speed because of the use of compression by the
	  modems.</p><p>Because the number of bits needed to describe a byte
	  varied during the trip between the two machines plus the
	  differing bits-per-seconds speeds that are used present on
	  the DTE-DCE and DCE-DCE links, the usage of the term Baud to
	  describe the overall communication speed causes problems and
	  can misrepresent the true transmission speed.  So Bits Per
	  Second (bps) is the correct term to use to describe the
	  transmission rate seen at the DCE to DCE interface and Baud
	  or Bits Per Second are acceptable terms to use when a
	  connection is made between two systems with a wired
	  connection, or if a modem is in use that is not performing
	  error-correction or compression.</p><p>Modern high speed modems (2400, 9600, 14,400, and

	    years ago, and the NS16550AFN no longer exists by that
	    name. (If you have a NS16550AFN, look at the date code on
	    the part, which is a four digit number that usually starts
	    with a nine.  The first two digits of the number are the

	    system can be found below.)</p><p>It is important to understand that in some stores, you
	    may pay $15(US) for a NS16550AFN made in 1990 and in
	    the next bin are the new PC16550DN parts with minor fixes
	    that National has made since the AFN part was in

	    six months and it costs half (as low as $5(US) in
	    volume) as much as the NS16550AFN because they are readily
	    available.</p><p>As the supply of NS16550AFN chips continues to shrink,

	  been licensed or copied by other chip vendors.  In the case
	  of the 8250, 8250A and 16450, the exact circuit (the
	  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">megacell</span>&#8221;</span>) was licensed to many vendors,
	  including Western Digital and Intel. Other vendors
	  reverse-engineered the part or produced emulations that had
	  similar behavior.</p><p>In internal modems, the modem designer will frequently
	  emulate the 8250A/16450 with the modem microprocessor, and
	  the emulated UART will frequently have a hidden buffer
	  consisting of several hundred bytes.  Because of the size of
	  the buffer, these emulations can be as reliable as a 16550A
	  in their ability to handle high speed data.  However, most
	  operating systems will still report that the UART is only a
	  8250A or 16450, and may not make effective use of the extra
	  buffering present in the emulated UART unless special
	  drivers are used.</p><p>Some modem makers are driven by market forces to abandon
	  a design that has hundreds of bytes of buffer and instead
	  use a 16550A UART so that the product will compare favorably
	  in market comparisons even though the effective performance
	  may be lowered by this action.</p><p>A common misconception is that all parts with
	  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">16550A</span>&#8221;</span> written on them are identical in
	  performance.  There are differences, and in some cases,
	  outright flaws in most of these 16550A clones.</p><p>When the NS16550 was developed, the National
	  Semiconductor obtained several patents on the design and
	  they also limited licensing, making it harder for other
	  vendors to provide a chip with similar features.  Because of
	  the patents, reverse-engineered designs and emulations had
	  to avoid infringing the claims covered by the patents.
	  Subsequently, these copies almost never perform exactly the
	  same as the NS16550A or PC16550D, which are the parts most
	  computer and modem makers want to buy but are sometimes
	  unwilling to pay the price required to get the genuine
	  part.</p><p>Some of the differences in the clone 16550A parts are
	  unimportant, while others can prevent the device from being
	  used at all with a given operating system or driver.  These
	  differences may show up when using other drivers, or when
	  particular combinations of events occur that were not well
	  tested or considered in the <span class="trademark">Windows</span>® driver.  This is because
	  most modem vendors and 16550-clone makers use the Microsoft
	  drivers from <span class="trademark">Windows</span>® for Workgroups 3.11 and the <span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>®
	  <span class="trademark">MS-DOS</span>® utility as the primary tests for compatibility with
	  the NS16550A.  This over-simplistic criteria means that if a
	  different operating system is used, problems could appear
	  due to subtle differences between the clones and genuine
	  components.</p><p>National Semiconductor has made available a program
	  named <span class="application">COMTEST</span> that performs
	  compatibility tests independent of any OS drivers.  It
	  should be remembered that the purpose of this type of
	  program is to demonstrate the flaws in the products of the
	  competition, so the program will report major as well as
	  extremely subtle differences in behavior in the part being
	  tested.</p><p>In a series of tests performed by the author of this
	  document in 1994, components made by National Semiconductor,
	  TI, StarTech, and CMD as well as megacells and emulations
	  embedded in internal modems were tested with COMTEST.  A
	  difference count for some of these components is listed
	  below. Because these tests were performed in 1994, they may
	  not reflect the current performance of the given product
	  from a vendor.</p><p>It should be noted that COMTEST normally aborts when an
	  excessive number or certain types of problems have been
	  detected.  As part of this testing, COMTEST was modified so
	  that it would not abort no matter how many differences were
	  encountered.</p><div class="informaltable"><table class="informaltable" width="100%" border="0"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Vendor</th><th>Part Number</th><th>Errors (aka "differences" reported)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>National</td><td>(PC16550DV)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>National</td><td>(NS16550AFN)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>National</td><td>(NS16C552V)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>TI</td><td>(TL16550AFN)</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>CMD</td><td>(16C550PE)</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>StarTech</td><td>(ST16C550J)</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Rockwell</td><td>Reference modem with internal 16550 or an

	    non-National parts that report zero differences using the
	    COMTEST program.  It should also be noted that National
	    has had five versions of the 16550 over the years and the
	    newest parts behave a bit differently than the classic
	    NS16550AFN that is considered the benchmark for
	    functionality.  COMTEST appears to turn a blind eye to the
	    differences within the National product line and reports
	    no errors on the National parts (except for the original
	    16550) even when there are official erratas that describe
	    bugs in the A, B and C revisions of the parts, so this
	    bias in COMTEST must be taken into account.</p></div><p>It is important to understand that a simple count of
	  differences from COMTEST does not reveal a lot about what
	  differences are important and which are not.  For example,
	  about half of the differences reported in the two modems
	  listed above that have internal UARTs were caused by the
	  clone UARTs not supporting five- and six-bit character
	  modes.  The real 16550, 16450, and 8250 UARTs all support
	  these modes and COMTEST checks the functionality of these
	  modes so over fifty differences are reported.  However,
	  almost no modern modem supports five- or six-bit characters,
	  particularly those with error-correction and compression
	  capabilities.  This means that the differences related to
	  five- and six-bit character modes can be discounted.</p><p>Many of the differences COMTEST reports have to do with
	  timing.  In many of the clone designs, when the host reads
	  from one port, the status bits in some other port may not
	  update in the same amount of time (some faster, some slower)
	  as a <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> NS16550AFN and COMTEST looks
	  for these differences.  This means that the number of
	  differences can be misleading in that one device may only
	  have one or two differences but they are extremely serious,
	  and some other device that updates the status registers
	  faster or slower than the reference part (that would
	  probably never affect the operation of a properly written
	  driver) could have dozens of differences reported.</p><p>COMTEST can be used as a screening tool to alert the
	  administrator to the presence of potentially incompatible
	  components that might cause problems or have to be handled
	  as a special case.</p><p>If you run COMTEST on a 16550 that is in a modem or a
	  modem is attached to the serial port, you need to first
	  issue a ATE0&amp;W command to the modem so that the modem
	  will not echo any of the test characters.  If you forget to
	  do this, COMTEST will report at least this one
	  difference:</p><pre class="screen">Error (6)...Timeout interrupt failed: IIR = c1  LSR = 61</pre></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45614584"></a>1.8. 8250/16450/16550 Registers</h3></div></div></div><p>The 8250/16450/16550 UART occupies eight contiguous I/O

	  1999</em></span></p><p>Ever wondered about FreeBSD support for your 20$
	  multi-I/O card with two (or more) COM ports, sharing IRQs?
	  Here is how:</p><p>Usually the only option to support these kind of boards
	  is to use a distinct IRQ for each port.  For example, if
	  your CPU board has an on-board <code class="filename">COM1</code>
	  port (aka <code class="filename">sio0</code>&#8211;I/O address
	  0x3F8 and IRQ 4) and you have an extension board with two
	  UARTs, you will commonly need to configure them as
	  <code class="filename">COM2</code> (aka
	  <code class="filename">sio1</code>&#8211;I/O address 0x2F8 and
	  IRQ 3), and the third port (aka
	  <code class="filename">sio2</code>) as I/O 0x3E8 and IRQ 5.
	  Obviously this is a waste of IRQ resources, as it should be
	  basically possible to run both extension board ports using a
	  single IRQ with the <code class="literal">COM_MULTIPORT</code>
	  configuration described in the previous sections.</p><p>Such cheap I/O boards commonly have a 4 by 3 jumper
	  matrix for the COM ports, similar to the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">            o  o  o  *
Port A               |
            o  *  o  *
Port B         |
            o  *  o  o
IRQ         2  3  4  5</pre><p>Shown here is port A wired for IRQ 5 and port B wired
	  for IRQ 3.  The IRQ columns on your specific board may
	  vary&#8212;other boards may supply jumpers for IRQs 3, 4, 5,
	  and 7 instead.</p><p>One could conclude that wiring both ports for IRQ 3
	  using a handcrafted wire-made jumper covering all three
	  connection points in the IRQ 3 column would solve the issue,
	  but no.  You cannot duplicate IRQ 3 because the output
	  drivers of each UART are wired in a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">totem
	  pole</span>&#8221;</span> fashion, so if one of the UARTs drives IRQ 3,
	  the output signal will not be what you would expect.
	  Depending on the implementation of the extension board or
	  your motherboard, the IRQ 3 line will continuously stay up,
	  or always stay low.</p><p>You need to decouple the IRQ drivers for the two UARTs,
	  so that the IRQ line of the board only goes up if (and only
	  if) one of the UARTs asserts a IRQ, and stays low otherwise.
	  The solution was proposed by Joerg Wunsch

IRQ         2  3  4  5    Diode</pre><p>The cathodes of the diodes are connected to a common
	  point, together with a 1 kOhm pull-down resistor.  It is
	  essential to connect the resistor to ground to avoid
	  floating of the IRQ line on the bus.</p><p>Now we are ready to configure a kernel.  Staying with
	  this example, we would configure:</p><pre class="programlisting"># standard on-board COM1 port
device          sio0    at isa? port "IO_COM1" flags 0x10
# patched-up multi-I/O extension board
options         COM_MULTIPORT
device          sio1    at isa? port "IO_COM2" flags 0x205
device          sio2    at isa? port "IO_COM3" flags 0x205 irq 3</pre><p>Note that the <code class="literal">flags</code> setting for
	  <code class="filename">sio1</code> and
	  <code class="filename">sio2</code> is truly essential; refer to
	  <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sio&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sio</span>(4)</span></a> for details. (Generally, the
	  <code class="literal">2</code> in the "flags" attribute refers to
	  <code class="filename">sio</code>2 which holds the IRQ, and you
	  surely want a <code class="literal">5</code> low nibble.)  With kernel
	  verbose mode turned on this should yield something similar
	  to this:</p><pre class="screen">sio0: irq maps: 0x1 0x11 0x1 0x1
sio0 at 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 flags 0x10 on isa
sio0: type 16550A
sio1: irq maps: 0x1 0x9 0x1 0x1
sio1 at 0x2f8-0x2ff flags 0x205 on isa
sio1: type 16550A (multiport)
sio2: irq maps: 0x1 0x9 0x1 0x1
sio2 at 0x3e8-0x3ef irq 3 flags 0x205 on isa
sio2: type 16550A (multiport master)</pre><p>Though <code class="filename">/sys/i386/isa/sio.c</code> is
	  somewhat cryptic with its use of the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">irq maps</span>&#8221;</span>
	  array above, the basic idea is that you observe
	  <code class="literal">0x1</code> in the first, third, and fourth
	  place.  This means that the corresponding IRQ was set upon
	  output and cleared after, which is just what we would
	  expect. If your kernel does not display this behavior, most
	  likely there is something wrong with your wiring.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="cy"></a>3. Configuring the <code class="filename">cy</code> driver</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Contributed by Alex Nash.  6 June

	<code class="filename">si</code> driver. A single machine can have
	up to 4 host cards. The following host cards are

	different, their functionality are basically the same. The
	host cards do not use I/O locations, but instead require a 32K
	chunk of memory. The factory configuration for ISA cards
	places this at <code class="literal">0xd0000-0xd7fff</code>.  They also
	require an IRQ. PCI cards will, of course, auto-configure
	themselves.</p><p>You can attach up to 4 external modules to each host
	card. The external modules contain either 4 or 8 serial
	ports. They come in the following varieties:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>SI 4 or 8 port modules. Up to 57600 bps on each port

	      supported. Like XIO, a module is available with one parallel
	      port as well.</p></li></ul></div><p>To configure an ISA host card, add the following line to

    developed by loose associations of programmers and freely
    exchanged. Starting in the early 1950's, organizations such as
    <a class="link" href="http://www.share.org" target="_top">SHARE</a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.decus.org" target="_top">DECUS</a> developed much of the
    software that computer hardware companies bundled with their
    hardware offerings. At that time computer companies were in the
    hardware business; anything that reduced software cost and made
    more programs available made the hardware companies more
    competitive.</p><p>This model changed in the 1960's. In 1965 ADR developed the
    first licensed software product independent of a hardware
    company. ADR was competing against a free IBM package originally
    developed by IBM customers. ADR patented their software in
    1968. To stop sharing of their program, they provided it under an
    equipment lease in which payment was spread over the lifetime of
    the product. ADR thus retained ownership and could control resale
    and reuse.</p><p>In 1969 the US Department of Justice charged IBM with
    destroying businesses by bundling free software with IBM
    hardware. As a result of this suit, IBM unbundled its software;
    that is, software became independent products separate from
    hardware.</p><p>In 1968 Informatics introduced the first commercial killer-app
    and rapidly established the concept of the software product, the
    software company, and very high rates of return. Informatics
    developed the perpetual license which is now standard throughout
    the computer industry, wherein ownership is never transferred to
    the customer.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="unix-license.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Why you should use a BSD style license for your Open Source Project </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. Unix from a BSD Licensing Perspective</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

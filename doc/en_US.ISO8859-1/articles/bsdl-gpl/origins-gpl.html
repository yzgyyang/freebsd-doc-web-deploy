    and early 1990s, the GPL, another development with important
    licensing considerations, reached fruition.</p><p>Richard Stallman, the developer of Emacs, was a member of the
    staff at MIT when his lab switched from home-grown to proprietary
    systems. Stallman became upset when he found that he could not
    legally add minor improvements to the system. (Many of Stallman's
    co-workers had left to form two companies based on software
    developed at MIT and licensed by MIT; there appears to have been
    disagreement over access to the source code for this software).
    Stallman devised an alternative to the commercial software license
    and called it the GPL, or "GNU Public License". He also started a
    non-profit foundation, the <a class="link" href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_top">Free
    Software Foundation</a> (FSF), which intended to develop an entire
    operating system, including all associated software, that would
    not be subject to proprietary licensing.  This system was called
    GNU, for "GNU is Not Unix".</p><p>The GPL was designed to be the antithesis of the standard
    proprietary license.  To this end, any modifications that were
    made to a GPL program were required to be given back to the GPL
    community (by requiring that the source of the program be
    available to the user) and any program that used or linked to GPL
    code was required to be under the GPL. The GPL was intended to
    keep software from becoming proprietary. As the last paragraph of
    the GPL states:</p><p><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">This General Public License does not permit
    incorporating your program into proprietary
    programs.</span>&#8221;</span>[1]</p><p>The <a class="link" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php" target="_top">GPL</a>
    is a complex license so here are some rules of thumb when using
    the GPL:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>you can charge as much as you want for
      distributing, supporting, or documenting the software, but you
      cannot sell the software itself.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the rule-of-thumb states that if GPL source
      is required for a program to compile, the program must be under
      the GPL. Linking statically to a GPL library requires a program
      to be under the GPL.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the GPL requires that any patents associated with
      GPLed software must be licensed for everyone's free
      use.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>simply aggregating software together, as when
      multiple programs are put on one disk, does not count as
      including GPLed programs in non-GPLed
      programs.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>output of a program does not count as a derivative
      work. This enables the gcc compiler to be used in commercial
      environments without legal problems.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>since the Linux kernel is under the GPL, any code
      statically linked with the Linux kernel must be GPLed. This
      requirement can be circumvented by dynamically linking loadable
      kernel modules. This permits companies to distribute binary
      drivers, but often has the disadvantage that they will only work
      for particular versions of the Linux kernel.</p></li></ul></div><p>Due in part to its complexity, in many parts of the world
    today the legalities of the GPL are being ignored in regard to
    Linux and related software. The long-term ramifications of this
    are unclear.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="current-bsdl.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="origins-lgpl.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">4. The Current State of FreeBSD and BSD Licenses </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 6. The origins of Linux and the LGPL</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

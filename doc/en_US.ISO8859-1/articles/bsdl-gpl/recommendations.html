      research results in a way that will widely be deployed and most
      benefit an economy. As such, research funding agencies, such as
      the NSF, ONR and DARPA, should encourage in the earliest phases
      of funded research projects, the adoption of BSD style licenses
      for software, data, results, and open hardware.  They should
      also encourage formation of standards based around implemented
      Open Source systems and ongoing Open Source
      projects.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Government policy should minimize the costs and
      difficulties in moving from research to deployment. When
      possible, grants should require results to be available under a
      commercialization friendly BSD style license.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In many cases, the long-term results of a BSD
      style license more accurately reflect the goals proclaimed in
      the research charter of universities than what occurs when
      results are copyrighted or patented and subject to proprietary
      university licensing. Anecdotal evidence exists that
      universities are financially better rewarded in the long run by
      releasing research results and then appealing to donations from
      commercially successful alumni.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Companies have long recognized that the creation
      of de facto standards is a key marketing technique. The BSD
      license serves this role well, if a company really has a unique
      advantage in evolving the system. The license is legally
      attractive to the widest audience while the company's expertise
      ensures their control. There are times when the GPL may be the
      appropriate vehicle for an attempt to create such a standard,
      especially when attempting to undermine or co-opt others. The
      GPL, however, penalizes the evolution of that standard, because
      it promotes a suite rather than a commercially applicable
      standard. Use of such a suite constantly raises
      commercialization and legal issues. It may not be possible to
      mix standards when some are under the GPL and others are not. A
      true technical standard should not mandate exclusion of other
      standards for non-technical reasons.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Companies interested in promoting an evolving
      standard, which can become the core of other companies' commercial
      products, should be wary of the GPL. Regardless of the license
      used, the resulting software will usually devolve to whoever
      actually makes the majority of the engineering changes and most
      understands the state of the system. The GPL simply adds
      more legal friction to the result.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Large companies, in which Open Source code is
      developed, should be aware that programmers appreciate Open Source
      because it leaves the software available to the employee when
      they change employers. Some companies encourage this behavior as
      an employment perk, especially when the software involved is not
      directly strategic. It is, in effect, a front-loaded retirement
      benefit with potential lost opportunity costs but no direct
      costs.  Encouraging employees to work for peer acclaim outside
      the company is a cheap portable benefit a company can sometimes
      provide with near zero downside.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Small companies with software projects vulnerable
      to orphaning should attempt to use the BSD license when
      possible. Companies of all sizes should consider forming such
      Open Source projects when it is to their mutual advantage to
      maintain the minimal legal and organization overheads associated
      with a true BSD-style Open Source project.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Non-profits should participate in Open Source
      projects when possible.  To minimize software engineering
      problems, such as mixing code under different licenses,
      BSD-style licenses should be encouraged. Being leery of the GPL
      should particularly be the case with non-profits that interact
      with the developing world. In some locales where application of
      law becomes a costly exercise, the simplicity of the new BSD
      license, as compared to the GPL, may be of considerable
      advantage.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bsd-advantages.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="conclusion.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">10. BSD Advantages </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 12. Conclusion</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

    publicly regulated monopoly tied up in anti-trust court; it was
    legally unable to sell a product into the software market. It was,
    however, able to provide it to academic institutions for the price
    of media.</p><p>Universities rapidly adopted Unix after an OS conference
    publicized its availability. It was extremely helpful that Unix
    ran on the PDP-11, a very affordable 16-bit computer, and was
    coded in a high-level language that was demonstrably good for
    systems programming. The DEC PDP-11 had, in effect, an open
    hardware interface designed to make it easy for customers to write
    their own OS, which was common. As DEC founder Ken Olsen famously
    proclaimed, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">software comes from heaven when you have good
    hardware</span>&#8221;</span>.</p><p>Unix author Ken Thompson returned to his alma mater,
    University of California Berkeley (UCB), in 1975 and taught the
    kernel line-by-line. This ultimately resulted in an evolving
    system known as BSD (Berkeley Standard Distribution).  UCB
    converted Unix to 32-bits, added virtual memory, and implemented
    the version of the TCP/IP stack upon which the Internet was
    essentially built. UCB made BSD available for the cost of media,
    under what became known as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">the BSD license</span>&#8221;</span>. A customer purchased
    Unix from AT&amp;T and then ordered a BSD tape from UCB.</p><p>In the mid-1980s a government anti-trust case against AT&amp;T
    ended with the break-up of AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T still owned Unix and was now
    able to sell it. AT&amp;T embarked on an aggressive licensing effort
    and most commercial Unixes of the day became AT&amp;T-derived.</p><p>In the early 1990's AT&amp;T sued UCB over license violations
    related to BSD. UCB discovered that AT&amp;T had incorporated, without
    acknowledgment or payment, many improvements due to BSD into AT&amp;T's
    products, and a lengthy court case, primarily between AT&amp;T and UCB,
    ensued. During this period some UCB programmers embarked on a
    project to rewrite any AT&amp;T code associated with BSD. This project
    resulted in a system called BSD 4.4-lite (lite because it was not
    a complete system; it lacked 6 key AT&amp;T files).</p><p>A lengthy series of articles published slightly later in
    Dr. Dobbs magazine described a BSD-derived 386 PC version of Unix,
    with BSD-licensed replacement files for the 6 missing 4.4 lite
    files. This system, named 386BSD, was due to ex-UCB programmer
    William Jolitz. It became the original basis of all the PC BSDs in
    use today.</p><p>In the mid 1990s, Novell purchased AT&amp;T's Unix rights and a
    (then secret) agreement was reached to terminate the lawsuit. UCB
    soon terminated its support for BSD.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="history.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="current-bsdl.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2. Very Brief Open Source History </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 4. The Current State of FreeBSD and BSD Licenses</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

    availability. Although a copyright holder can traditionally change
    the terms of a copyright at anytime, the presumption in the BSD
    community is that such an attempt simply causes the source to
    fork.</p><p>The GPL explicitly disallows revoking the license. It has
    occurred, however, that a company (Mattel) purchased a GPL
    copyright (cphack), revoked the entire copyright, went to court,
    and prevailed [2]. That is, they legally revoked the entire
    distribution and all derivative works based on the
    copyright. Whether this could happen with a larger and more
    dispersed distribution is an open question; there is also some
    confusion regarding whether the software was really under the
    GPL.</p><p>In another example, Red Hat purchased Cygnus, an engineering
    company that had taken over development of the FSF compiler
    tools. Cygnus was able to do so because they had developed a
    business model in which they sold support for GNU software. This
    enabled them to employ some 50 engineers and drive the direction
    of the programs by contributing the preponderance of
    modifications. As Donald Rosenberg states "projects using licenses
    like the GPL...live under constant threat of having someone take
    over the project by producing a better version of the code and
    doing it faster than the original owners."

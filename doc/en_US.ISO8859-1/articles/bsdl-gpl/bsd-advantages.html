    research or other projects that need a development environment
    that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>has near zero cost</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>will evolve over a long period of
      time</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>permits anyone to retain the option of
      commercializing final results with minimal legal
      issues.</p></li></ul></div><p>This final consideration may often be the dominant one, as it
    was when the Apache project decided upon its license:</p><p><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">This type of license is ideal for promoting the use of
    a reference body of code that implements a protocol for common
    service. This is another reason why we choose it for the Apache
    group - many of us wanted to see HTTP survive and become a true
    multiparty standard, and would not have minded in the slightest if
    Microsoft or Netscape choose to incorporate our HTTP engine or any
    other component of our code into their products, if it helped
    further the goal of keeping HTTP common... All this means that,
    strategically speaking, the project needs to maintain sufficient
    momentum, and that participants realize greater value by
    contributing their code to the project, even code that would have
    had value if kept proprietary.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>Developers tend to find the BSD license attractive as it keeps
    legal issues out of the way and lets them do whatever they want
    with the code. In contrast, those who expect primarily to use a
    system rather than program it, or expect others to evolve the
    code, or who do not expect to make a living from their work
    associated with the system (such as government employees), find
    the GPL attractive, because it forces code developed by others to
    be given to them and keeps their employer from retaining copyright
    and thus potentially "burying" or orphaning the software. If you
    want to force your competitors to help you, the GPL is
    attractive.</p><p>A BSD license is not simply a gift. The question <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">why
    should we help our competitors or let them steal our work?</span>&#8221;</span>
    comes up often in relation to a BSD license. Under a BSD license,
    if one company came to dominate a product niche that others
    considered strategic, the other companies can, with minimal
    effort, form a mini-consortium aimed at reestablishing parity by
    contributing to a competitive BSD variant that increases market
    competition and fairness.  This permits each company to believe
    that it will be able to profit from some advantage it can provide,
    while also contributing to economic flexibility and
    efficiency. The more rapidly and easily the cooperating members
    can do this, the more successful they will be. A BSD license is
    essentially a minimally complicated license that enables such
    behavior.</p><p>A key effect of the GPL, making a complete and competitive
    Open Source system widely available at cost of media, is a
    reasonable goal. A BSD style license, in conjunction with
    ad-hoc-consortiums of individuals, can achieve this goal without
    destroying the economic assumptions built around the
    deployment-end of the technology transfer pipeline.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="gpl-advantages.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="recommendations.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">9. GPL Advantages and Disadvantages </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 11. Specific Recommendations for using a BSD license</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

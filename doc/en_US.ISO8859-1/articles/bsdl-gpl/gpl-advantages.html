    the gcc compiler.  This is particularly apt when working with
    one-off specialty CPUs in environments where all software costs
    are likely to be considered overhead, with minimal expectations
    that others will use the resulting compiler.</p><p>The GPL is also attractive to small companies selling CDs in
    an environment where "buy-low, sell-high" may still give the
    end-user a very inexpensive product. It is also attractive to
    companies that expect to survive by providing various forms of
    technical support, including documentation, for the GPLed
    intellectual property world.</p><p>A less publicized and unintended use of the GPL is that it is
    very favorable to large companies that want to undercut software
    companies. In other words, the GPL is well suited for use as a
    marketing weapon, potentially reducing overall economic benefit
    and contributing to monopolistic behavior.</p><p>The GPL can present a real problem for those wishing to
    commercialize and profit from software. For example, the GPL adds
    to the difficulty a graduate student will have in directly forming
    a company to commercialize his research results, or the difficulty
    a student will have in joining a company on the assumption that a
    promising research project will be commercialized.</p><p>For those who must work with statically-linked implementations
    of multiple software standards, the GPL is often a poor license,
    because it precludes using proprietary implementations of the
    standards. The GPL thus minimizes the number of programs that can
    be built using a GPLed standard. The GPL was intended to not
    provide a mechanism to develop a standard on which one engineers
    proprietary products. (This does not apply to Linux applications
    because they do not statically link, rather they use a trap-based
    API.)</p><p>The GPL attempts to make programmers contribute to an evolving
    suite of programs, then to compete in the distribution and support
    of this suite. This situation is unrealistic for many required
    core system standards, which may be applied in widely varying
    environments which require commercial customization or integration
    with legacy standards under existing (non-GPL) licenses.
    Real-time systems are often statically linked, so the GPL and LGPL
    are definitely considered potential problems by many embedded
    systems companies.</p><p>The GPL is an attempt to keep efforts, regardless of demand,
    at the research and development stages. This maximizes the
    benefits to researchers and developers, at an unknown cost to
    those who would benefit from wider distribution.</p><p>The GPL was designed to keep research results from
    transitioning to proprietary products. This step is often assumed
    to be the last step in the traditional technology transfer
    pipeline and it is usually difficult enough under the best of
    circumstances; the GPL was intended to make it impossible.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="license-cannot.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bsd-advantages.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">8. What a license cannot do </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 10. BSD Advantages</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

      already well established as your responsibility, then there is
      probably little need to check with other committers before
      jumping in with a commit.  Working on a bug in an area of the
      system which is clearly orphaned (and there are a few such
      areas, to our shame), the same applies.  When modifying
      parts of the system which are maintained, formally, or
      informally, consider asking for review just as a developer
      would have before becoming a
      committer.  For ports, contact the listed
      <code class="varname">MAINTAINER</code> in the
      <code class="filename">Makefile</code>.</p><p>To determine if an area of the tree is maintained, check the
      MAINTAINERS file at the root of the tree.  If nobody is listed,
      scan the revision history to see who has committed
      changes in the past.  An example script that lists each person
      who has committed to a given file along with the number of
      commits each person has made can be found at on
      <code class="systemitem">freefall</code> at
      <code class="filename">~eadler/bin/whodid</code>.  If queries go
      unanswered or the committer otherwise indicates a lack of
      interest in the area affected, go ahead and commit it.</p><div xmlns="" class="important"><h3 class="admontitle">Important: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avoid sending private emails to maintainers.  Other people
	might be interested in the conversation, not just the final
	output.</p></div><p>If there is any doubt about a commit for any reason at all,
      have it reviewed before
      committing.  Better to have it flamed then and there rather than
      when it is part of the repository.  If a commit does results in
      controversy erupting, it may be advisable to consider backing
      the change out again until the matter is settled.  Remember,
      with a version control system we can always change it
      back.</p><p>Do not impugn the intentions of others.  If they see a
      different solution to a problem, or even a different problem, it
      is probably not because they are stupid, because they have
      questionable parentage, or because they are trying to destroy
      hard work, personal image, or FreeBSD, but basically because they
      have a different outlook on the world.  Different is
      good.</p><p>Disagree honestly.  Argue your position from its merits,
      be honest about any shortcomings it may have, and be open to
      seeing their solution, or even their vision of the problem,
      with an open mind.</p><p>Accept correction.  We are all fallible.  When you have made
      a mistake, apologize and get on with life.  Do not beat up
      yourself, and certainly do not beat up others for your mistake.
      Do not waste time on embarrassment or recrimination, just fix
      the problem and move on.</p><p>Ask for help.  Seek out (and give) peer reviews.  One of
      the ways open source software is supposed to excel is in the
      number of eyeballs applied to it; this does not apply if nobody
      will review code.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="tracking.license.grants.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="if-in-doubt.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">10. Keeping Track of Licenses Granted to the FreeBSD

      As committers, you form the public face of the project, and how
      you behave has a vital impact on the public perception of it.

      suspension or, upon repeated offense, permanent removal of
      commit privileges.  Individual members of core have the power to
      temporarily suspend commit privileges until core as a whole has
      the chance to review the issue.  In case of an
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">emergency</span>&#8221;</span> (a committer doing damage to the
      repository), a temporary suspension may also be done by the
      repository meisters.  Only a 2/3 majority of core has the
      authority to suspend commit privileges for longer than a week or
      to remove them permanently.  This rule does not exist to set
      core up as a bunch of cruel dictators who can dispose of
      committers as casually as empty soda cans, but to give the
      project a kind of safety fuse.  If someone is out of control, it
      is important to be able to deal with this immediately rather
      than be paralyzed by debate.  In all cases, a committer whose
      privileges are suspended or revoked is entitled to a
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">hearing</span>&#8221;</span> by core, the total duration of the
      suspension being determined at that time.  A committer whose
      privileges are suspended may also request a review of the
      decision after 30 days and every 30 days thereafter (unless the
      total suspension period is less than 30 days).  A committer
      whose privileges have been revoked entirely may request a review
      after a period of 6 months has elapsed.  This review policy is
      <span class="emphasis"><em>strictly informal</em></span> and, in all cases, core
      reserves the right to either act on or disregard requests for
      review if they feel their original decision to be the right
      one.</p><p>In all other aspects of project operation, core is a subset
      of committers and is bound by the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>same rules</em></span>.  Just because someone is in
      core this does not mean that they have special dispensation to
      step outside any of the lines painted here; core's
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">special powers</span>&#8221;</span> only kick in when it acts as a
      group, not on an individual basis.  As individuals, the core
      team members are all committers first and core second.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp51476344"></a>18.1. Details</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><a id="respect"></a>Respect other committers.</p><p>This means that you need to treat other committers as
	    the peer-group developers that they are.  Despite our
	    occasional attempts to prove the contrary, one does not
	    get to be a committer by being stupid and nothing rankles
	    more than being treated that way by one of your peers.
	    Whether we always feel respect for one another or not (and
	    everyone has off days), we still have to
	    <span class="emphasis"><em>treat</em></span> other committers with respect
	    at all times, on public forums and in private
	    email.</p><p>Being able to work together long term is this
	    project's greatest asset, one far more important than any
	    set of changes to the code, and turning arguments about
	    code into issues that affect our long-term ability to work
	    harmoniously together is just not worth the trade-off by
	    any conceivable stretch of the imagination.</p><p>To comply with this rule, do not send email when you
	    are angry or otherwise behave in a manner which is likely
	    to strike others as needlessly confrontational.  First
	    calm down, then think about how to communicate in the most
	    effective fashion for convincing the other persons that
	    your side of the argument is correct, do not just blow off
	    some steam so you can feel better in the short term at the
	    cost of a long-term flame war.  Not only is this very bad
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">energy economics</span>&#8221;</span>, but repeated displays of
	    public aggression which impair our ability to work well
	    together will be dealt with severely by the project
	    leadership and may result in suspension or termination of
	    your commit privileges.  The project leadership will take
	    into account both public and private communications
	    brought before it.  It will not seek the disclosure of
	    private communications, but it will take it into account
	    if it is volunteered by the committers involved in the
	    complaint.</p><p>All of this is never an option which the project's
	    leadership enjoys in the slightest, but unity comes first.
	    No amount of code or good advice is worth trading that
	    away.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Respect other contributors.</p><p>You were not always a committer.  At one time you were
	    a contributor.  Remember that at all times.  Remember what
	    it was like trying to get help and attention.  Do not
	    forget that your work as a contributor was very important
	    to you.  Remember what it was like.  Do not discourage,
	    belittle, or demean contributors.  Treat them with
	    respect.  They are our committers in waiting.  They are
	    every bit as important to the project as committers.
	    Their contributions are as valid and as important as your
	    own.  After all, you made many contributions before you
	    became a committer.  Always remember that.</p><p>Consider the points raised under
	    <a class="xref" href="rules.html#respect">1</a> and apply them also to
	    contributors.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Discuss any significant change
	    <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> committing.</p><p>The repository is not where changes are initially
	    submitted for correctness or argued over, that happens
	    first in the mailing lists or by use of the Phabricator
	    service.  The commit will only happen once something
	    resembling consensus has been reached.  This does not mean
	    that permission is required before correcting every
	    obvious syntax error or manual page misspelling, just that
	    it is good to develop a feel for when a proposed change is
	    not quite such a no-brainer and requires some feedback
	    first.  People really do not mind sweeping changes if the
	    result is something clearly better than what they had
	    before, they just do not like being
	    <span class="emphasis"><em>surprised</em></span> by those changes.  The very
	    best way of making sure that things are on the right track
	    is to have code reviewed by one or more other
	    committers.</p><p>When in doubt, ask for review!</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Respect existing maintainers if listed.</p><p>Many parts of FreeBSD are not <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">owned</span>&#8221;</span> in
	    the sense that any specific individual will jump up and
	    yell if you commit a change to <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">their</span>&#8221;</span> area,
	    but it still pays to check first.  One convention we use
	    is to put a maintainer line in the
	    <code class="filename">Makefile</code> for any package or subtree
	    which is being actively maintained by one or more people;
	    see <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/policies.html" target="_top">https://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/policies.html</a>
	    for documentation on this.  Where sections of code have
	    several maintainers, commits to affected areas by one
	    maintainer need to be reviewed by at least one other
	    maintainer.  In cases where the
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">maintainer-ship</span>&#8221;</span> of something is not clear,
	    look at the repository logs for the files
	    in question and see if someone has been working recently
	    or predominantly in that area.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Any disputed change must be backed out pending
	    resolution of the dispute if requested by a maintainer.
	    Security related changes may override a maintainer's
	    wishes at the Security Officer's discretion.</p><p>This may be hard to swallow in times of conflict (when
	    each side is convinced that they are in the right, of
	    course) but a version control system makes it unnecessary
	    to have an ongoing dispute raging when it is far easier to
	    simply reverse the disputed change, get everyone calmed
	    down again and then try to figure out what is the best way
	    to proceed.  If the change turns out to be the best thing
	    after all, it can be easily brought back.  If it turns out
	    not to be, then the users did not have to live with the
	    bogus change in the tree while everyone was busily
	    debating its merits.  People <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span>
	    rarely call for back-outs in the repository since
	    discussion generally exposes bad or controversial changes
	    before the commit even happens, but on such rare occasions
	    the back-out should be done without argument so that we
	    can get immediately on to the topic of figuring out
	    whether it was bogus or not.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Changes go to FreeBSD-CURRENT before FreeBSD-STABLE unless

	    merging so that it can be given sufficient testing.  The
	    release engineer has the same authority over the
	    FreeBSD-STABLE branch as outlined in rule #5.</p><p>This is another <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">do not argue about it</span>&#8221;</span>
	    issue since it is the release engineer who is ultimately
	    responsible (and gets beaten up) if a change turns out to
	    be bad.  Please respect this and give the release engineer
	    your full cooperation when it comes to the FreeBSD-STABLE
	    branch.  The management of FreeBSD-STABLE may frequently seem
	    to be overly conservative to the casual observer, but also
	    bear in mind the fact that conservatism is supposed to be
	    the hallmark of FreeBSD-STABLE and different rules apply
	    there than in FreeBSD-CURRENT.  There is also really no point
	    in having FreeBSD-CURRENT be a testing ground if changes are
	    merged over to FreeBSD-STABLE immediately.  Changes need a
	    chance to be tested by the FreeBSD-CURRENT developers, so
	    allow some time to elapse before merging unless the
	    FreeBSD-STABLE fix is critical, time sensitive or so obvious
	    as to make further testing unnecessary (spelling fixes to
	    manual pages, obvious bug/typo fixes, etc.)  In other
	    words, apply common sense.</p><p>Changes to the security branches (for example,

	    bad.</p><p>This project has a public image to uphold and that
	    image is very important to all of us, especially if we are
	    to continue to attract new members.  There will be
	    occasions when, despite everyone's very best attempts at
	    self-control, tempers are lost and angry words are
	    exchanged.  The best thing that can be done in such cases
	    is to minimize the effects of this until everyone has
	    cooled back down.  Do not air
	    angry words in public and do not forward private
	    correspondence or other private communications to public
	    mailing lists, mail aliases, instant messaging channels or
	    social media sites.  What people say one-to-one is often
	    much less sugar-coated than what they would say in public,
	    and such communications therefore have no place there -
	    they only serve to inflame an already bad situation.  If
	    the person sending a flame-o-gram at least had the
	    grace to send it privately, then have the grace to keep it
	    private yourself.  If you feel you are being unfairly
	    treated by another developer, and it is causing you
	    anguish, bring the matter up with core rather than taking
	    it public.  Core will do its best to play peace makers and
	    get things back to sanity.  In cases where the dispute
	    involves a change to the codebase and the participants do
	    not appear to be reaching an amicable agreement, core may
	    appoint a mutually-agreeable third party to resolve the
	    dispute.  All parties involved must then agree to be bound
	    by the decision reached by this third party.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Respect all code freezes and read the

	    Patches may be committed to FreeBSD first with permission

	    wanting strict control over a tightly coupled dependency
	    to lack of portability in the canonical repository's
	    distribution of their code.  Regardless of the reason,
	    effort to minimize the maintenance burden of fork is
	    helpful to fellow maintainers.  Avoid committing trivial
	    or cosmetic changes to files since it makes every merge

	    confidentiality.  Sometimes the need for confidentiality
	    comes from external collaborators or has a specific time
	    limit.  Mostly though, it is a matter of not releasing
	    private communications.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The Security Officer has sole control over the
	    release of security advisories.</p><p>Where there are security problems that affect many
	    different operating systems, FreeBSD frequently depends on
	    early access to be able to prepare advisories for
	    coordinated release.  Unless FreeBSD developers can be
	    trusted to maintain security, such early access will not
	    be made available.  The Security Officer is responsible
	    for controlling pre-release access to information about
	    vulnerabilities, and for timing the release of all
	    advisories.  He may request help under condition of
	    confidentiality from any developer with relevant knowledge
	    to prepare security fixes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Communications with Core are kept confidential for as
	    long as necessary.</p><p>Communications to core will initially be treated as
	    confidential.  Eventually however, most of Core's business
	    will be summarized into the monthly or quarterly core
	    reports.  Care will be taken to avoid publicising any
	    sensitive details.  Records of some particularly sensitive
	    subjects may not be reported on at all and will be
	    retained only in Core's private archives.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Non-disclosure Agreements may be required for access
	    to certain commercially sensitive data.</p><p>Access to certain commercially sensitive data may
	    only be available under a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  The
	    FreeBSD Foundation legal staff must be consulted before
	    any binding agreements are entered into.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Private communications must not be made
	    public without permission.</p><p>Beyond the specific requirements above there is a
	    general expectation not to publish private communications
	    between developers without the consent of all parties
	    involved.  Ask permission before forwarding a message onto
	    a public mailing list, or posting it to a forum or website
	    that can be accessed by other than the original
	    correspondents.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Communications on project-only or restricted access
	    channels must be kept private.</p><p>Similarly to personal communications, certain
	    internal communications channels, including FreeBSD Committer
	    only mailing lists and restricted access IRC channels
	    are considered private communications.  Permission is
	    required to publish material from these
	    sources.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Core may approve publication.</p><p>Where it is impractical to obtain permission due to
	    the number of correspondents or where permission to
	    publish is unreasonably withheld, Core may approve release
	    of such private matters that merit more general
	    publication.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="coverity.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="archs.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">17. <span class="trademark">Coverity</span>® Availability for FreeBSD Committers </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 19. Support for Multiple Architectures</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

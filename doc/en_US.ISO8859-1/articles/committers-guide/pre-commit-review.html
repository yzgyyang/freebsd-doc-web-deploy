      The following guidelines apply to commits to the
      <code class="literal">head</code> (-CURRENT) branch of the
      <code class="literal">src</code> repository.  Other branches and the
      <code class="literal">ports</code> and <code class="literal">docs</code> trees have
      their own review policies, but these guidelines generally apply
      to commits requiring review:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>All non-trivial changes should be reviewed before they
	  are committed to the repository.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Reviews may be conducted by email, in
	  <span class="application">Bugzilla</span>, in
	  <span class="application">Phabricator</span>, or by another
	  mechanism.  Where possible, reviews should be public.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The developer responsible for a code change is also
	  responsible for making all necessary review-related
	  changes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Code review can be an iterative process, which continues
	  until the patch is ready to be committed.  Specifically,
	  once a patch is sent out for review, it should receive an
	  explicit <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">looks good</span>&#8221;</span> before it is committed.
	  So long as it is explicit, this can take whatever form makes
	  sense for the review method.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Timeouts are not a substitute for review.</p></li></ul></div><p>Sometimes code reviews will take longer than you would hope
      for, especially for larger features.  Accepted ways to speed up
      review times for your patches are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Review other people's patches.  If you help out,
	  everybody will be more willing to do the same for you;
	  goodwill is our currency.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ping the patch.  If it is urgent, provide reasons why
	  it is important to you to get this patch landed and ping
	  it every couple of days.  If it is not urgent, the common
	  courtesy ping rate is one week.  Remember that you are
	  asking for valuable time from other professional
	  developers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ask for help on mailing lists, IRC, etc.  Others
	  may be able to either help you directly, or suggest a
	  reviewer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Split your patch into multiple smaller patches that
	  build on each other.  The smaller your patch, the higher
	  the probability that somebody will take a quick look at
	  it.</p><p>When making large changes, it is helpful to keep this
	  in mind from the beginning of the effort as breaking large
	  changes into smaller ones is often difficult after the
	  fact.</p></li></ul></div><p>Developers should participate in code reviews as both
      reviewers and reviewees.  If someone is kind enough to review
      your code, you should return the favor for someone else.
      Note that while anyone is welcome to review and give feedback
      on a patch, only an appropriate subject-matter expert can
      approve a change.  This will usually be a committer who works
      with the code in question on a regular basis.</p><p>In some cases, no subject-matter expert may be available.
      In those cases, a review by an experienced developer is
      sufficient when coupled with appropriate testing.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="conventions.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="commit-log-message.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">6. Setup, Conventions, and Traditions </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 8. Commit Log Messages</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

 */</pre><p>The FreeBSD project strongly discourages the so-called
      "advertising clause" in new code.  Due to the large number of
      contributors to the FreeBSD project, complying with this clause for
      many commercial vendors has become difficult.  If you have code
      in the tree with the advertising clause, please consider
      removing it.  In fact, please consider using the above license
      for your code.</p><p>The FreeBSD project discourages completely new licenses and
      variations on the standard licenses.  New licenses require the
      approval of the Core Team <code class="email">&lt;<a xmlns="" class="email" href="mailto:core@FreeBSD.org">core@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;</code> to reside in the
      main repository.  The more different licenses that are used in
      the tree, the more problems that this causes to those wishing to
      utilize this code, typically from unintended consequences from a
      poorly worded license.</p><p>Project policy dictates that code under some non-BSD
      licenses must be placed only in specific sections of the
      repository, and in some cases, compilation must be conditional
      or even disabled by default.  For example, the GENERIC kernel
      must be compiled under only licenses identical to or
      substantially similar to the BSD license.  GPL, APSL, CDDL, etc,
      licensed software must not be compiled into GENERIC.</p><p>Developers are reminded that in open source, getting "open"
      right is just as important as getting "source" right, as
      improper handling of intellectual property has serious
      consequences.  Any questions or concerns should immediately be
      brought to the attention of the core team.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="commit-log-message.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="tracking.license.grants.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">8. Commit Log Messages </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 10. Keeping Track of Licenses Granted to the FreeBSD

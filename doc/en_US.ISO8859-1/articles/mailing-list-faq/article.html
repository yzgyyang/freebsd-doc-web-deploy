		This may seem a little silly, since your message still

		editor to trim the information to what is relevant, or cut

		like <code class="command">dmesg</code>, redirect the output to a

      in any community, requires a common basis for communication.
      Many of the mailing lists presuppose a knowledge of the
      Project's history.  In particular, there are certain topics
      that seem to regularly occur to newcomers to the community.
      It is the responsibility of each poster to ensure that
      their postings do not fall into one of these categories.
      By doing so, you will help the mailing lists to stay on-topic,
      and probably save yourself being flamed in the process.</p><p>The best method to avoid this is to familiarize yourself
      with the <a class="link" href="http://docs.FreeBSD.org/mail/" target="_top">
      mailing list archives</a>,
      to help yourself understand the background of
      what has gone before.  In this, the <a class="link" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html#mailinglists" target="_top">
      mailing list search interface</a>
      is invaluable.  (If that method does not yield useful results,
      please supplement it with a search with your favorite major
      search engine).</p><p>By familiarizing yourself with the archives, not only will
      you learn what topics have been discussed before, but also how
      discussion tends to proceed on that list, who the participants
      are, and who the target audience is.  These are always good things
      to know before you post to any mailing list, not just a FreeBSD
      mailing list.</p><p>There is no doubt that the archives are quite extensive, and
      some questions recur more often than others, sometimes as followups
      where the subject line no longer accurately reflects the new content.
      Nevertheless, the burden is on you, the poster, to do your homework
      to help avoid these recurring topics.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="bikeshed"></a>4. What Is A "Bikeshed"?</h2></div></div></div><p>Literally, a <code class="literal">bikeshed</code> is a small outdoor
	shelter into which one may store one's two-wheeled form of
	transportation.  However, in FreeBSD parlance, the term refers to
	topics that are simple enough that (nearly) anyone can offer an
	opinion about, and often (nearly) everyone does. The
	genesis of this term is explained in more detail <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/misc.html#bikeshed-painting" target="_top">
	in this document</a>.  You simply must have a working
	knowledge of this concept before posting to any FreeBSD mailing
	list.</p><p>More generally, a bikeshed is a topic that will tend to
	generate immediate meta-discussions and flames if you have
	not read up on their past history.</p><p>Please help us to keep the mailing lists as useful for as
	many people as possible by avoiding bikesheds whenever you can.

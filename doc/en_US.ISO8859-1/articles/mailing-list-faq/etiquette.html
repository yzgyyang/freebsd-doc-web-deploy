	    reading this document.  However, if you are new to FreeBSD,
	    you may first need to familiarize yourself with the
	    software, and all the social history around it, by
	    reading the numerous
	    <a class="link" href="../../../../docs/books.html" target="_top">books and articles</a>
	    that are available.  Items of particular interest
	    include the <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/index.html" target="_top">
	    FreeBSD Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> document,
	    the <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html" target="_top">

	    already answered in the above documents.  This is not because
	    the volunteers who work on this project are particularly mean
	    people, but after a certain number of times answering the same
	    questions over and over again, frustration begins to set in.
	    This is particularly true if there is an existing answer to the
	    question that is already available.  Always keep in mind that
	    almost all of the work done on FreeBSD is done by volunteers,
	    and that we are only human.</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idp46969592"></a><a id="inappropriate"></a><p><strong>2.2.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>What constitutes an inappropriate posting?</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Postings must be in accordance with the charter

		infinite.  Not everyone reads email through high-speed
		connections, so if your posting involves something like
		the content of <code class="filename">config.log</code> or an
		extensive stack trace, please consider putting that
		information up on a website somewhere and just provide
		a URL to it.  Remember, too, that these postings will
		be archived indefinitely, so huge postings will simply
		inflate the size of the archives long after their
		purpose has expired.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Format your message so that it is legible, and
		PLEASE DO NOT SHOUT!!!!!.  Do not underestimate the
		effect that a poorly formatted mail message has, and not
		just on the FreeBSD mailing lists.  Your mail message is
		all that people see of you, and if it is poorly formatted,
		badly spelled, full of errors, and/or has lots of exclamation
		points, it will give people a poor impression of you.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Please use an appropriate human language for a
		particular mailing list.  Many non-English mailing
		lists are
		<a class="link" href="../../../../community/mailinglists.html" target="_top">
		available</a>.</p><p>For the ones that are not, we do appreciate that many
		people do not speak English as their first language,
		and we try to make allowances for that.  It is considered
		particularly poor form to criticize non-native speakers
		for spelling or grammatical errors.  FreeBSD has an
		excellent track record in this regard; please, help us
		to uphold that tradition.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Please use a standards-compliant Mail User Agent (MUA).
		A lot of badly formatted messages come from
		<a class="link" href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/email/email.php" target="_top">bad
		mailers or badly configured mailers</a>.  The following mailers
		are known to send out badly formatted messages without you
		finding out about them:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>exmh</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>® Exchange</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>® <span class="trademark">Outlook</span>®</p></li></ul></div><p>Try not
		to use <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym>: a lot of people use mailers
		which do not get on very well with
		<acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure your time and time zone are set correctly.
		This may seem a little silly, since your message still
		gets there, but many of the people on these mailing lists
		get several hundred messages a day.  They frequently sort
		the incoming messages by subject and by date, and if your
		message does not come before the first answer, they may
		assume that they missed it and not bother to look.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A lot of the information you need to supply is the
		output of programs, such as <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a>, or console
		messages, which usually appear in
		<code class="filename">/var/log/messages</code>.  Do not try to copy
		this information by typing it in again; not only it is a
		real pain, but you are bound to make a mistake.  To send log
		file contents, either make a copy of the file and use an
		editor to trim the information to what is relevant, or cut
		and paste into your message.  For the output of programs
		like <code class="command">dmesg</code>, redirect the output to a
		file and include that.  For example,</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>dmesg &gt; /tmp/dmesg.out</code></strong></pre><p>This redirects the information to the file
		<code class="filename">/tmp/dmesg.out</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When using cut-and-paste, please be aware that some
		such operations badly mangle their messages.  This is of
		particular concern when posting contents of
		<code class="filename">Makefiles</code>, where <code class="literal">tab</code>
		is a significant character.  This is a very common,
		and very annoying, problem with submissions to the
		<a class="link" href="../../../../support.html" target="_top">
		Problem Reports database</a>.
		<code class="filename">Makefiles</code> with tabs changed to either
		spaces, or the annoying <code class="literal">=3B</code> escape
		sequence, create a great deal of aggravation for
		committers.</p></li></ul></div></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idp47053432"></a><a id="etiquette-replying"></a><p><strong>2.4.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>What are the special etiquette consideration when replying

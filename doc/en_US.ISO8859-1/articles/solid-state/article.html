      disk devices made from flash memory.  Flash memory is a solid
      state memory (no moving parts) that is non-volatile (the memory
      maintains data even after all power sources have been
      disconnected).  Flash memory can withstand tremendous physical
      shock and is reasonably fast (the flash memory solutions covered
      in this article are slightly slower than a EIDE hard disk for
      write operations, and much faster for read operations).  One
      very important aspect of flash memory, the ramifications of
      which will be discussed later in this article, is that each
      sector has a limited rewrite capacity.  You can only write,
      erase, and write again to a sector of flash memory a certain
      number of times before the sector becomes permanently unusable.
      Although many flash memory products automatically map bad
      blocks, and although some even distribute write operations
      evenly throughout the unit, the fact remains that there exists a
      limit to the amount of writing that can be done to the device.
      Competitive units have between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 writes
      per sector in their specification.  This figure varies due to
      the temperature of the environment.</p><p>Specifically, we will be discussing ATA compatible
      compact-flash units, which are quite popular as storage media
      for digital cameras.  Of particular interest is the fact that
      they pin out directly to the IDE bus and are compatible with the
      ATA command set.  Therefore, with a very simple and low-cost
      adaptor, these devices can be attached directly to an IDE bus in
      a computer.  Once implemented in this manner, operating systems
      such as FreeBSD see the device as a normal hard disk (albeit
      small).</p><p>Other solid state disk solutions do exist, but their
      expense, obscurity, and relative unease of use places them
      beyond the scope of this article.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="kernel"></a>2. Kernel Options</h2></div></div></div><p>A few kernel options are of specific interest to those
      creating an embedded FreeBSD system.</p><p>All embedded FreeBSD systems that use flash memory as system
      disk will be interested in memory disks and memory filesystems.
      Because of the limited number of writes that can be done to
      flash memory, the disk and the filesystems on the disk will most
      likely be mounted read-only.  In this environment, filesystems
      such as <code class="filename">/tmp</code> and <code class="filename">/var</code>
      are mounted as memory filesystems to allow the system to create
      logs and update counters and temporary files.  Memory
      filesystems are a critical component to a successful solid state
      FreeBSD implementation.</p><p>You should make sure the following lines exist in your
      kernel configuration file:</p><pre class="programlisting">options         MFS             # Memory Filesystem
options         MD_ROOT         # md device usable as a potential root device
pseudo-device   md              # memory disk</pre></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ro-fs"></a>3. The <code class="literal">rc</code> Subsystem and Read-Only
      Filesystems</h2></div></div></div><p>The post-boot initialization of an embedded FreeBSD system is
      controlled by <code class="filename">/etc/rc.initdiskless</code>.</p><p><code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code> mounts
      <code class="filename">/var</code> as a memory filesystem, makes a
      configurable list of directories in <code class="filename">/var</code>
      with the <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mkdir&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">mkdir</span>(1)</span></a> command, and changes modes on some of
      those directories.  In the execution of
      <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code>, one other
      <code class="filename">rc.conf</code> variable comes into play &#8211;
      <code class="literal">varsize</code>.  A <code class="filename">/var</code>
      partition is created by <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code> based
      on the value of this variable in
      <code class="filename">rc.conf</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">varsize=8192</pre><p>Remember that this value is in sectors by default.</p><p>The fact that <code class="filename">/var</code> is a read-write
      filesystem is an important distinction, as the
      <code class="filename">/</code> partition (and any other partitions you
      may have on your flash media) should be mounted read-only.
      Remember that in <a class="xref" href="#intro" title="1. Solid State Disk Devices">Section 1, &#8220;Solid State Disk Devices&#8221;</a> we detailed the
      limitations of flash memory - specifically the limited write
      capability.  The importance of not mounting filesystems on flash
      media read-write, and the importance of not using a swap file,
      cannot be overstated.  A swap file on a busy system can burn
      through a piece of flash media in less than one year.  Heavy
      logging or temporary file creation and destruction can do the
      same.  Therefore, in addition to removing the
      <code class="literal">swap</code> entry from your
      <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code>, you should also change the
      Options field for each filesystem to <code class="literal">ro</code> as
      follows:</p><pre class="programlisting"># Device                Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
/dev/ad0s1a             /               ufs     ro              1       1</pre><p>A few applications in the average system will immediately
      begin to fail as a result of this change.  For instance, cron
      will not run properly as a result of missing cron tabs in the
      <code class="filename">/var</code> created by
      <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code>, and syslog and dhcp will
      encounter problems as well as a result of the read-only
      filesystem and missing items in the <code class="filename">/var</code>
      that <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code> has created.  These are
      only temporary problems though, and are addressed, along with
      solutions to the execution of other common software packages in
      <a class="xref" href="#strategies" title="5. System Strategies for Small and Read Only Environments">Section 5, &#8220;System Strategies for Small and Read Only
      Environments&#8221;</a>.</p><p>An important thing to remember is that a filesystem that was
      mounted read-only with <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> can be
      made read-write at any time by issuing the command:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>/sbin/mount -uw <em class="replaceable"><code>partition</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>and can be toggled back to read-only with the
      command:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>/sbin/mount -ur <em class="replaceable"><code>partition</code></em></code></strong></pre></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idp45085048"></a>4. Building a File System from Scratch</h2></div></div></div><p>Because ATA compatible compact-flash cards are seen by FreeBSD
      as normal IDE hard drives, you could theoretically install FreeBSD
      from the network using the kern and mfsroot floppies or from a
      CD.</p><p>However, even a small installation of FreeBSD using normal
      installation procedures can produce a system in size of greater
      than 200 megabytes.  Because most people will be using smaller
      flash memory devices (128 megabytes is considered fairly large -
      32 or even 16 megabytes is common) an installation using normal
      mechanisms is not possible&#8212;there is simply not enough disk
      space for even the smallest of conventional
      installations.</p><p>The easiest way to overcome this space limitation is to
      install FreeBSD using conventional means to a normal hard disk.
      After the installation is complete, pare down the operating
      system to a size that will fit onto your flash media, then tar
      the entire filesystem.  The following steps will guide you
      through the process of preparing a piece of flash memory for
      your tarred filesystem.  Remember, because a normal installation
      is not being performed, operations such as partitioning,
      labeling, file-system creation, etc. need to be performed by
      hand.  In addition to the kern and mfsroot floppy disks, you
      will also need to use the fixit floppy.</p><div class="procedure"><ol class="procedure" type="1"><li class="step"><p class="title"><strong>Partitioning Your Flash Media Device</strong></p><p>After booting with the kern and mfsroot floppies, choose
	  <code class="literal">custom</code> from the installation menu.  In
	  the custom installation menu, choose
	  <code class="literal">partition</code>.  In the partition menu, you
	  should delete all existing partitions using
	  <span class="keycap"><strong>d</strong></span>.  After deleting all existing
	  partitions, create a partition using <span class="keycap"><strong>c</strong></span>
	  and accept the default value for the size of the
	  partition.  When asked for the type of the partition, make
	  sure the value is set to <code class="literal">165</code>.  Now write
	  this partition table to the disk by pressing
	  <span class="keycap"><strong>w</strong></span> (this is a hidden option on this
	  screen).  If you are using an ATA compatible compact flash
	  card, you should choose the FreeBSD Boot Manager.  Now press
	  <span class="keycap"><strong>q</strong></span> to quit the partition menu.  You
	  will be shown the boot manager menu once more - repeat the
	  choice you made earlier.</p></li><li class="step"><p class="title"><strong>Creating Filesystems on Your Flash Memory
	  Device</strong></p><p>Exit the custom installation menu, and from the main
	  installation menu choose the <code class="literal">fixit</code>
	  option.  After entering the fixit environment, enter the
	  following command:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>disklabel -e /dev/ad0c</code></strong></pre><p>At this point you will have entered the vi editor under
	  the auspices of the disklabel command.  Next, you need to
	  add an <code class="literal">a:</code> line at the end of the file.
	  This <code class="literal">a:</code> line should look like:</p><pre class="programlisting">a:      <em class="replaceable"><code>123456</code></em>  0       4.2BSD  0       0</pre><p>Where <em class="replaceable"><code>123456</code></em> is a number that
	  is exactly the same as the number in the existing
	  <code class="literal">c:</code> entry for size.  Basically you are
	  duplicating the existing <code class="literal">c:</code> line as an
	  <code class="literal">a:</code> line, making sure that fstype is
	  <code class="literal">4.2BSD</code>.  Save the file and exit.</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>disklabel -B -r /dev/ad0c</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>newfs /dev/ad0a</code></strong></pre></li><li class="step"><p class="title"><strong>Placing Your Filesystem on the Flash Media</strong></p><p>Mount the newly prepared flash media:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>mount /dev/ad0a /flash</code></strong></pre><p>Bring this machine up on the network so we may transfer
	  our tar file and explode it onto our flash media filesystem.
	  One example of how to do this is:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>ifconfig xl0 192.168.0.10 netmask 255.255.255.0</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>route add default 192.168.0.1</code></strong></pre><p>Now that the machine is on the network, transfer your
	  tar file.  You may be faced with a bit of a dilemma at this
	  point - if your flash memory part is 128 megabytes, for
	  instance, and your tar file is larger than 64 megabytes, you
	  cannot have your tar file on the flash media at the same
	  time as you explode it - you will run out of
	  space.  One solution to this problem, if you are using FTP,
	  is to untar the file while it is transferred over FTP.  If
	  you perform your transfer in this manner, you will never
	  have the tar file and the tar contents on your disk at the
	  same time:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">ftp&gt;</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>get tarfile.tar "| tar xvf -"</code></strong></pre><p>If your tarfile is gzipped, you can accomplish this as
	  well:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">ftp&gt;</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>get tarfile.tar "| zcat | tar xvf -"</code></strong></pre><p>After the contents of your tarred filesystem are on your
	  flash memory filesystem, you can unmount the flash memory
	  and reboot:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>cd /</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>umount /flash</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>exit</code></strong></pre><p>Assuming that you configured your filesystem correctly
	  when it was built on the normal hard disk (with your
	  filesystems mounted read-only, and with the necessary
	  options compiled into the kernel) you should now be
	  successfully booting your FreeBSD embedded system.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="strategies"></a>5. System Strategies for Small and Read Only

      Filesystems&#8221;</a>, it was pointed out that the
      <code class="filename">/var</code> filesystem constructed by
      <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code> and the presence of a
      read-only root filesystem causes problems with many common
      software packages used with FreeBSD.  In this article, suggestions
      for successfully running cron, syslog, ports installations, and
      the Apache web server will be provided.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45170680"></a>5.1. Cron</h3></div></div></div><p>Upon boot, <code class="filename">/var</code> gets populated by
	<code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code> using the list from
	<code class="filename">/etc/mtree/BSD.var.dist</code>, so the
	<code class="filename">cron</code>, <code class="filename">cron/tabs</code>,
	<code class="filename">at</code>, and a few other standard directories
	get created.</p><p>However, this does not solve the problem of maintaining
	cron tabs across reboots.  When the system reboots, the
	<code class="filename">/var</code> filesystem that is in memory will
	disappear and any cron tabs you may have had in it will also
	disappear.  Therefore, one solution would be to create cron
	tabs for the users that need them, mount your
	<code class="filename">/</code> filesystem as read-write and copy those
	cron tabs to somewhere safe, like
	<code class="filename">/etc/tabs</code>, then add a line to the end of
	<code class="filename">/etc/rc.initdiskless</code> that copies those
	crontabs into <code class="filename">/var/cron/tabs</code> after that
	directory has been created during system initialization.  You
	may also need to add a line that changes modes and permissions
	on the directories you create and the files you copy with
	<code class="filename">/etc/rc.initdiskless</code>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45185528"></a>5.2. Syslog</h3></div></div></div><p><code class="filename">syslog.conf</code> specifies the locations
	of certain log files that exist in
	<code class="filename">/var/log</code>.  These files are not created by
	<code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code> upon system initialization.
	Therefore, somewhere in <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code>,
	after the section that creates the directories in
	<code class="filename">/var</code>, you will need to add something like
	this:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>touch /var/log/security /var/log/maillog /var/log/cron /var/log/messages</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>chmod 0644 /var/log/*</code></strong></pre></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45209592"></a>5.3. Ports Installation</h3></div></div></div><p>Before discussing the changes necessary to successfully
	use the ports tree, a reminder is necessary regarding the
	read-only nature of your filesystems on the flash media.
	Since they are read-only, you will need to temporarily mount
	them read-write using the mount syntax shown in <a class="xref" href="#ro-fs" title="3. The rc Subsystem and Read-Only Filesystems">Section 3, &#8220;The <code class="literal">rc</code> Subsystem and Read-Only
      Filesystems&#8221;</a>.  You should always remount those
	filesystems read-only when you are done with any maintenance -
	unnecessary writes to the flash media could considerably
	shorten its lifespan.</p><p>To make it possible to enter a ports directory and
	successfully run <code class="command">make</code>
	<code class="buildtarget">install</code>, we must create a packages
	directory on a non-memory filesystem that will keep track of
	our packages across reboots.  Because it is necessary to mount
	your filesystems as read-write for the installation of a
	package anyway, it is sensible to assume that an area on the
	flash media can also be used for package information to be
	written to.</p><p>First, create a package database directory.  This is
	normally in <code class="filename">/var/db/pkg</code>, but we cannot
	place it there as it will disappear every time the system is
	booted.</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>mkdir /etc/pkg</code></strong></pre><p>Now, add a line to <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code> that
	links the <code class="filename">/etc/pkg</code> directory to
	<code class="filename">/var/db/pkg</code>.  An example:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>ln -s /etc/pkg /var/db/pkg</code></strong></pre><p>Now, any time that you mount your filesystems as
	read-write and install a package, the <code class="command">make</code>
	<code class="buildtarget">install</code> will work, and package
	information will be written successfully to
	<code class="filename">/etc/pkg</code> (because the filesystem will, at

	  is set up to write its pid or log information outside of
	  <code class="filename">/var</code>.  By default, Apache keeps its pid

	directory
	<code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>apache_log_dir</code></em></code>
	outside of <code class="filename">/var</code>.  When this directory
	lives on a read-only filesystem, Apache will not be able to
	save any log files, and may have problems working.  If so, it
	is necessary to add a new directory to the list of directories
	in <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/var</code> to create in
	<code class="filename">/var</code>, and to link
	<code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>apache_log_dir</code></em></code>

	to set permissions and ownership on this new directory.</p><p>First, add the directory <code class="literal">log/apache</code> to

<code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>chown nobody:nobody /var/log/apache</code></strong></pre><p>Finally, remove the existing
	<code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>apache_log_dir</code></em></code>

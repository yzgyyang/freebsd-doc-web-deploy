      operating system.  It is deployed on millions of web servers and
      internet-facing hosts worldwide.  FreeBSD code also forms an
      integral part of many products, ranging from appliances such as
      network routers, firewalls, and storage devices, to personal
      computers.  Portions of FreeBSD have also been used in
      commercial shrink-wrapped software (see
      <a class="xref" href="#freebsd-intro" title="2. FreeBSD as a set of building blocks">Section 2, &#8220;FreeBSD as a set of building blocks&#8221;</a>).</p><p>In this article we look at the <a class="link" href="../../../../" target="_top">FreeBSD project</a> as a software
      engineering resource&#8212;as a collection of building blocks
      and processes which you can use to build products.</p><p>While FreeBSD's source is distributed freely to the public,
      to fully enjoy the benefits of the project's work, organizations
      need to <span class="emphasis"><em>collaborate</em></span> with the project.  In
      subsequent sections of this article we discuss effective means
      of collaboration with the project and the pitfalls that need to
      be avoided while doing so.</p><p><span class="formalpara-title">Caveat Reader. </span>The author believes that the characteristics of the FreeBSD
      	Project listed in this article were substantially true at the
	time the article was conceived and written (2005).  However, the
	reader should keep in mind that the practices and processes used
	by open-source communities can change over time, and that the information
	in this article should therefore be taken as indicative rather
	than normative.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45053560"></a>1.1. Target Audience</h3></div></div></div><p>This document would be of interest to the following broad

            customized FreeBSD kernel and application program set
            along with a proprietary management layer for their
            device. OEMs benefit from new hardware support being added
            by the FreeBSD project upstream, and from the testing that
            the base system receives.</p><p class="simpara">FreeBSD ships with a self-hosting development

            performance issues and bugs.  The involvement of

Use double precision to simplify and optimize arg reduction for small
and medium size args too: instead of conditionally subtracting a float
17+24, 17+17+24 or 17+17+17+24 bit approximation to pi/2, always
subtract a double 33+53 bit one.  The float version is now closer to
the double version than to old versions of itself -- it uses the same
33+53 bit approximation as the simplest cases in the double version,
and where the float version had to switch to the slow general case at
|x| == 2^7*pi/2, it now switches at |x| == 2^19*pi/2 the same as the
double version.

This speeds up arg reduction by a factor of 2 for |x| between 3*pi/4 and
2^7*pi/4, and by a factor of 7 for |x| between 2^7*pi/4 and 2^19*pi/4.

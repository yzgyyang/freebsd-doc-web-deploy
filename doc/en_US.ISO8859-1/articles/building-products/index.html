      operating system.  It is deployed on millions of web servers and
      internet-facing hosts worldwide.  FreeBSD code also forms an
      integral part of many products, ranging from appliances such as
      network routers, firewalls, and storage devices, to personal
      computers.  Portions of FreeBSD have also been used in
      commercial shrink-wrapped software (see
      <a class="xref" href="freebsd-intro.html" title="2. FreeBSD as a set of building blocks">Section 2, &#8220;FreeBSD as a set of building blocks&#8221;</a>).</p><p>In this article we look at the <a class="link" href="../../../../" target="_top">FreeBSD project</a> as a software
      engineering resource&#8212;as a collection of building blocks
      and processes which you can use to build products.</p><p>While FreeBSD's source is distributed freely to the public,
      to fully enjoy the benefits of the project's work, organizations
      need to <span class="emphasis"><em>collaborate</em></span> with the project.  In
      subsequent sections of this article we discuss effective means
      of collaboration with the project and the pitfalls that need to
      be avoided while doing so.</p><p><span class="formalpara-title">Caveat Reader. </span>The author believes that the characteristics of the FreeBSD
      	Project listed in this article were substantially true at the
	time the article was conceived and written (2005).  However, the
	reader should keep in mind that the practices and processes used
	by open-source communities can change over time, and that the information
	in this article should therefore be taken as indicative rather
	than normative.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp46902392"></a>1.1. Target Audience</h3></div></div></div><p>This document would be of interest to the following broad

      software user is to submit a problem report only to have it
      summarily closed with a terse and unhelpful explanation like
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">not a bug</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bogus PR</span>&#8221;</span>.  Similarly,
      one of the most frustrating experiences as a software developer
      is to be flooded with problem reports that are not really
      problem reports but requests for support, or that contain little
      or no information about what the problem is and how to reproduce
      it.</p><p>This document attempts to describe how to write good problem
      reports.  What, one asks, is a good problem report?  Well, to go
      straight to the bottom line, a good problem report is one that
      can be analyzed and dealt with swiftly, to the mutual
      satisfaction of both user and developer.</p><p>Although the primary focus of this article is on FreeBSD
      problem reports, most of it should apply quite well to other
      software projects.</p><p>Note that this article is organized thematically, not
      chronologically.  Read the entire document
      before submitting a problem report, rather than treating it as a
      step-by-step tutorial.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="pr-when"></a>2. When to Submit a Problem Report</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many types of problems, and not all of them should
      engender a problem report.  Of course, nobody is perfect, and
      there will be times when what seems to be a bug in a program is,
      in fact, a misunderstanding of the syntax for a command or a
      typographical error in a configuration file (though that in
      itself may sometimes be indicative of poor documentation or poor
      error handling in the application).  There are still many cases
      where submitting a problem report is clearly
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the right course of action, and will
      only serve to frustrate both the submitter and the developers.
      Conversely, there are cases where it might be appropriate to
      submit a problem report about something else than a bug&#8212;an
      enhancement or a new feature, for instance.</p><p>So how does one determine what is a bug and what is not?  As
      a simple rule of thumb, the problem is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      a bug if it can be expressed as a question (usually of the form
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">How do I do X?</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Where can I find
      Y?</span>&#8221;</span>).  It is not always quite so black and white, but the
      question rule covers a large majority of cases.  When looking
      for an answer, consider posing the question to the
      <a class="link" href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions" target="_top">FreeBSD general questions mailing list</a>.</p><p>Consider these factors when submitting PRs about ports or
      other software that is not part of FreeBSD itself:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Please do not submit problem reports that simply state
	  that a newer version of an application is available.  Ports
	  maintainers are automatically notified by
	  <span class="application">portscout</span> when a new version of
	  an application becomes available.  Actual patches to update
	  a port to the latest version are welcome.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For unmaintained ports (<code class="varname">MAINTAINER</code>
	  is <code class="literal">ports@FreeBSD.org</code>),
	  a PR without an included patch is unlikely to get picked up
	  by a committer.  To become the maintainer of an
	  unmaintained port, submit a PR with the request (patch
	  preferred but not required).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In either case, following the process described in <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/port-upgrading.html" target="_top">Porter's
	    Handbook</a> will yield the best results.  (You might
	  also wish to read <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributing/ports-contributing.html" target="_top">Contributing
	    to the FreeBSD Ports Collection</a>.)</p></li></ul></div><p>A bug that cannot be reproduced can rarely be fixed.  If the
      bug only occurred once and you cannot reproduce it, and it does
      not seem to happen to anybody else, chances are none of the
      developers will be able to reproduce it or figure out what is
      wrong.  That does not mean it did not happen, but it does mean
      that the chances of your problem report ever leading to a bug
      fix are very slim.  To make matters worse, often these kinds of
      bugs are actually caused by failing hard drives or overheating
      processors &#8212; you should always try to rule out these
      causes, whenever possible, before submitting a PR.</p><p>Next, to decide to whom you should file your problem report,
      you need to understand that the software that makes up FreeBSD is
      composed of several different elements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by FreeBSD contributors, such as the kernel, the C library, and
	  the device drivers (categorized as <code class="literal">kern</code>);
	  the binary utilities (<code class="literal">bin</code>); the manual
	  pages and documentation (<code class="literal">docs</code>); and the
	  web pages (<code class="literal">www</code>).  All bugs in these areas
	  should be reported to the FreeBSD developers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by others, and imported into FreeBSD and adapted.  Examples
	  include <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=clang&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">clang</span>(1)</span></a>, and
	  <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sendmail&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sendmail</span>(8)</span></a>.  Most bugs in these areas should be
	  reported to the FreeBSD developers; but in some cases they may
	  need to be reported to the original authors instead if the
	  problems are not FreeBSD-specific.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Individual applications that are not in the base system
	  but are instead part of the FreeBSD Ports Collection (category
	  <code class="literal">ports</code>).  Most of these applications are
	  not written by FreeBSD developers; what FreeBSD provides is merely
	  a framework for installing the application.  Therefore, only
	  report a problem to the FreeBSD developers when the problem is
	  believed to be FreeBSD-specific; otherwise, report it to the
	  authors of the software.</p></li></ul></div><p>Then, ascertain whether the problem is timely.  There are
      few things that will annoy a developer more than receiving a
      problem report about a bug she has already fixed.</p><p>If the problem is in the base system, first read the FAQ
      section on <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/introduction.html#LATEST-VERSION" target="_top">FreeBSD
	versions</a>, if you are not already familiar with the
      topic.  It is not possible for FreeBSD to fix problems in anything
      other than certain recent branches of the base system, so filing
      a bug report about an older version will probably only result in
      a developer advising you to upgrade to a supported version to
      see if the problem still recurs.  The Security Officer team
      maintains the
      <a class="link" href="../../../../security/" target="_top">list of supported
	versions</a>.</p><p>If the problem is in a port, consider filing a bug with the
      upstream.  The FreeBSD Project can not fix all bugs in all
      software.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="pr-prep"></a>3. Preparations</h2></div></div></div><p>A good rule to follow is to always do a background search
      before submitting a problem report.  Maybe the problem has
      already been reported; maybe it is being discussed on the
      mailing lists, or recently was; it may even already be fixed in
      a newer version than what you are running.  You should therefore
      check all the obvious places before submitting your problem
      report.  For FreeBSD, this means:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The FreeBSD <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/index.html" target="_top">Frequently Asked

      report, and that it is a FreeBSD problem, it is time to write the

      tricks to help make sure that your PR will be most
      effective.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="pr-writing-tips"></a>4.1. Tips and Tricks for Writing a Good Problem Report</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Do not leave the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Summary</span>&#8221;</span>

	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Summary</span>&#8221;</span> is used for the
	    <code class="literal">Subject:</code> line), but also into a
	    database.  Anyone who comes along later and browses the
	    database by synopsis, and finds a PR with a blank subject
	    line, tends just to skip over it.  Remember that PRs stay
	    in this database until they are closed by someone; an

	      line.</em></span>  You should not assume that anyone
	    reading your PR has any context for your submission, so
	    the more you provide, the better.  For instance, what part
	    of the system does the problem apply to?  Do you only see
	    the problem while installing, or while running?  To
	    illustrate, instead of
	    <code class="literal">Summary: portupgrade is broken</code>, see
	    how much more informative this seems:
	    <code class="literal">Summary: port ports-mgmt/portupgrade coredumps
	      on -current</code>.  (In the case of ports, it is
	    especially helpful to have both the category and portname
	    in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Summary</span>&#8221;</span> line.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you have a patch, say so.</em></span>

	either <code class="command">svn diff</code> or
	<a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">diff</span>(1)</span></a> with the <code class="option">-u</code> option
	to create a unified diff
	and make sure to specify the SVN revision number of the
	repository against which you modified files,
	so the developers who read your report will
	be able to apply them easily.  For problems with the kernel or
	the base utilities, a patch against FreeBSD-CURRENT (the HEAD
	Subversion branch) is preferred since all new code should be
	applied and tested there first.  After appropriate or
	substantial testing has been done, the code will be
	merged/migrated to the FreeBSD-STABLE branch.</p><p>If you attach a patch inline, instead of as an attachment,
	note that the most common problem by far is the tendency of
	some email programs to render tabs as spaces, which will
	completely ruin anything intended to be part of a
	Makefile.</p><p>Do not send patches as attachments using
	<code class="command">Content-Transfer-Encoding:
	  quoted-printable</code>.  These will perform character
	escaping and the entire patch will be useless.</p><p>Also note that while including small patches in a PR is
	generally all right&#8212;particularly when they fix the
	problem described in the PR&#8212;large patches and especially
	new code which may require substantial review before
	committing should be placed on a web or ftp server, and the
	URL should be included in the PR instead of the patch.
	Patches in email tend to get mangled,
	and the larger the patch, the harder it will be for
	interested parties to unmangle it.  Also, posting a patch on
	the web allows you to modify it without having to resubmit the
	entire patch in a followup to the original PR.  Finally, large
	patches simply increase the size of the database, since closed
	PRs are not actually deleted but instead kept and simply
	marked as complete.</p><p>You should also take note that unless you explicitly
	specify otherwise in your PR or in the patch itself, any
	patches you submit will be assumed to be licensed under the
	same terms as the original file you modified.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="pr-writing-filling-template"></a>4.4. Filling out the Form</h3></div></div></div><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The email address you use will become public

	    short and accurate description of the problem.  The
	    synopsis is used as the subject of the problem report
	    email, and is used in problem report listings and

	    <code class="literal">Affects only me</code>,
	    <code class="literal">Affects some people</code> or <code class="literal">Affects
	      many people</code>.
	    Do not overreact; refrain from labeling your problem
	    <code class="literal">Affects many people</code> unless it really
	    does.  FreeBSD developers will not
	    necessarily work on your problem faster if you inflate its
	    importance since there are so many other people who have
	    done exactly that.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Category:</em></span> Choose an appropriate
	    category.</p><p>The first thing you need to do is to decide what part
	    of the system your problem lies in.  Remember, FreeBSD is a
	    complete operating system, which installs both a kernel,
	    the standard libraries, many peripheral drivers, and a
	    large number of utilities (the
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">base system</span>&#8221;</span>).  However, there are thousands
	    of additional applications in the Ports Collection.
	    You'll first need to decide if the problem is in the base
	    system or something installed via the Ports
	    Collection.</p><p>Here is a description of the major categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>If a problem is with the kernel, the libraries
		(such as standard C library <code class="literal">libc</code>),
		or a peripheral driver in the base system, in general
		you will use the <code class="literal">kern</code> category.
		(There are a few exceptions; see below).  In general
		these are things that are described in section 2, 3,
		or 4 of the manual pages.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If a problem is with a binary program such as
		<a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sh</span>(1)</span></a> or <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">mount</span>(8)</span></a>, you will first need to
		determine whether these programs are in the base
		system or were added via the Ports Collection.  If you
		are unsure, you can do <code class="command">whereis
		  <em class="replaceable"><code>programname</code></em></code>.
		FreeBSD's convention for the Ports Collection is to
		install everything underneath
		<code class="filename">/usr/local</code>,
		although this can be overridden by a system
		administrator.  For these, you will use the
		<code class="literal">ports</code> category (yes, even if the
		port's category is <code class="literal">www</code>; see below).
		If the location is
		<code class="filename">/bin</code>,
		<code class="filename">/usr/bin</code>,
		<code class="filename">/sbin</code>, or
		<code class="filename">/usr/sbin</code>, it
		is part of the base system, and you should use the
		<code class="literal">bin</code> category.  These are all things
		that are described in section 1 or 8 of the manual
		pages.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you believe that the error is in the startup
		<code class="literal">(rc)</code> scripts, or in some kind of
		other non-executable configuration file, then the
		right category is <code class="literal">conf</code>
		(configuration).  These are things that are described
		in section 5 of the manual pages.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have found a problem in the documentation

      confirmation by email which will include the tracking number
      that was assigned to your problem report and a URL you can use
      to check its status.  With a little luck, someone will take an
      interest in your problem and try to address it, or, as the case
      may be, explain why it is not a problem.  You will be
      automatically notified of any change of status, and you will
      receive copies of any comments or patches someone may attach to
      your problem report's audit trail.</p><p>If someone requests additional information from you, or you
      remember or discover something you did not mention in the
      initial report, please submit a follow up.  The number one
      reason for a bug not getting fixed is lack of communication with
      the originator.  The easiest way is to use the comment
      option on the individual PR's web page, which you can reach
      from the <a class="link" href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/query.cgi" target="_top">PR
	search page</a>.</p><p>If the problem report remains open after the problem has
      gone away, just add a comment
      saying that the problem report can be closed, and, if
      possible, explaining how or when the problem was fixed.</p><p>Sometimes there is a delay of a week or two where the
      problem report remains untouched, not assigned or commented on
      by anyone.  This can happen when there is an increased problem
      report backlog or during a holiday season.  When a problem
      report has not received attention after several weeks, it is
      worth finding a committer particularly interested in working on
      it.</p><p>There are a few ways to do so, ideally in the following

	  Inform the people in that channel about the problem report

	  after posting, so that the people from different time zones
	  around the world have a chance to catch up.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Find committers interested in the problem that was

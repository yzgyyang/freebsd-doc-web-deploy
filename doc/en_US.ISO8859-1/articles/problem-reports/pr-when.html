      engender a problem report.  Of course, nobody is perfect, and
      there will be times when what seems to be a bug in a program is,
      in fact, a misunderstanding of the syntax for a command or a
      typographical error in a configuration file (though that in
      itself may sometimes be indicative of poor documentation or poor
      error handling in the application).  There are still many cases
      where submitting a problem report is clearly
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the right course of action, and will
      only serve to frustrate both the submitter and the developers.
      Conversely, there are cases where it might be appropriate to
      submit a problem report about something else than a bug&#8212;an
      enhancement or a new feature, for instance.</p><p>So how does one determine what is a bug and what is not?  As
      a simple rule of thumb, the problem is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      a bug if it can be expressed as a question (usually of the form
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">How do I do X?</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Where can I find
      Y?</span>&#8221;</span>).  It is not always quite so black and white, but the
      question rule covers a large majority of cases.  When looking
      for an answer, consider posing the question to the
      <a class="link" href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions" target="_top">FreeBSD general questions mailing list</a>.</p><p>Consider these factors when submitting PRs about ports or
      other software that is not part of FreeBSD itself:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Please do not submit problem reports that simply state
	  that a newer version of an application is available.  Ports
	  maintainers are automatically notified by
	  <span class="application">portscout</span> when a new version of
	  an application becomes available.  Actual patches to update
	  a port to the latest version are welcome.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For unmaintained ports (<code class="varname">MAINTAINER</code>
	  is <code class="literal">ports@FreeBSD.org</code>),
	  a PR without an included patch is unlikely to get picked up
	  by a committer.  To become the maintainer of an
	  unmaintained port, submit a PR with the request (patch
	  preferred but not required).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In either case, following the process described in <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/port-upgrading.html" target="_top">Porter's
	    Handbook</a> will yield the best results.  (You might
	  also wish to read <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributing/ports-contributing.html" target="_top">Contributing
	    to the FreeBSD Ports Collection</a>.)</p></li></ul></div><p>A bug that cannot be reproduced can rarely be fixed.  If the
      bug only occurred once and you cannot reproduce it, and it does
      not seem to happen to anybody else, chances are none of the
      developers will be able to reproduce it or figure out what is
      wrong.  That does not mean it did not happen, but it does mean
      that the chances of your problem report ever leading to a bug
      fix are very slim.  To make matters worse, often these kinds of
      bugs are actually caused by failing hard drives or overheating
      processors &#8212; you should always try to rule out these
      causes, whenever possible, before submitting a PR.</p><p>Next, to decide to whom you should file your problem report,
      you need to understand that the software that makes up FreeBSD is
      composed of several different elements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by FreeBSD contributors, such as the kernel, the C library, and
	  the device drivers (categorized as <code class="literal">kern</code>);
	  the binary utilities (<code class="literal">bin</code>); the manual
	  pages and documentation (<code class="literal">docs</code>); and the
	  web pages (<code class="literal">www</code>).  All bugs in these areas
	  should be reported to the FreeBSD developers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by others, and imported into FreeBSD and adapted.  Examples
	  include <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=clang&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">clang</span>(1)</span></a>, and
	  <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sendmail&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sendmail</span>(8)</span></a>.  Most bugs in these areas should be
	  reported to the FreeBSD developers; but in some cases they may
	  need to be reported to the original authors instead if the
	  problems are not FreeBSD-specific.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Individual applications that are not in the base system
	  but are instead part of the FreeBSD Ports Collection (category
	  <code class="literal">ports</code>).  Most of these applications are
	  not written by FreeBSD developers; what FreeBSD provides is merely
	  a framework for installing the application.  Therefore, only
	  report a problem to the FreeBSD developers when the problem is
	  believed to be FreeBSD-specific; otherwise, report it to the
	  authors of the software.</p></li></ul></div><p>Then, ascertain whether the problem is timely.  There are
      few things that will annoy a developer more than receiving a
      problem report about a bug she has already fixed.</p><p>If the problem is in the base system, first read the FAQ
      section on <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/introduction.html#LATEST-VERSION" target="_top">FreeBSD
	versions</a>, if you are not already familiar with the
      topic.  It is not possible for FreeBSD to fix problems in anything
      other than certain recent branches of the base system, so filing
      a bug report about an older version will probably only result in
      a developer advising you to upgrade to a supported version to
      see if the problem still recurs.  The Security Officer team
      maintains the
      <a class="link" href="../../../../security/" target="_top">list of supported
	versions</a>.</p><p>If the problem is in a port, consider filing a bug with the
      upstream.  The FreeBSD Project can not fix all bugs in all
      software.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="pr-prep.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Writing FreeBSD Problem Reports </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. Preparations</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

      actual problem report.  Before we get into the mechanics of the
      program used to generate and submit PRs, here are some tips and
      tricks to help make sure that your PR will be most
      effective.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="pr-writing-tips"></a>4.1. Tips and Tricks for Writing a Good Problem Report</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Do not leave the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Summary</span>&#8221;</span>

	    list that goes all over the world (where the
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Summary</span>&#8221;</span> is used for the
	    <code class="literal">Subject:</code> line), but also into a
	    database.  Anyone who comes along later and browses the
	    database by synopsis, and finds a PR with a blank subject
	    line, tends just to skip over it.  Remember that PRs stay
	    in this database until they are closed by someone; an
	    anonymous one will usually just disappear in the

	    the more you provide, the better.  For instance, what part
	    of the system does the problem apply to?  Do you only see
	    the problem while installing, or while running?  To
	    illustrate, instead of
	    <code class="literal">Summary: portupgrade is broken</code>, see
	    how much more informative this seems:
	    <code class="literal">Summary: port ports-mgmt/portupgrade coredumps
	      on -current</code>.  (In the case of ports, it is
	    especially helpful to have both the category and portname

	to create a unified diff
	and make sure to specify the SVN revision number of the
	repository against which you modified files,
	so the developers who read your report will
	be able to apply them easily.  For problems with the kernel or
	the base utilities, a patch against FreeBSD-CURRENT (the HEAD
	Subversion branch) is preferred since all new code should be
	applied and tested there first.  After appropriate or
	substantial testing has been done, the code will be
	merged/migrated to the FreeBSD-STABLE branch.</p><p>If you attach a patch inline, instead of as an attachment,
	note that the most common problem by far is the tendency of
	some email programs to render tabs as spaces, which will
	completely ruin anything intended to be part of a
	Makefile.</p><p>Do not send patches as attachments using
	<code class="command">Content-Transfer-Encoding:
	  quoted-printable</code>.  These will perform character
	escaping and the entire patch will be useless.</p><p>Also note that while including small patches in a PR is
	generally all right&#8212;particularly when they fix the
	problem described in the PR&#8212;large patches and especially
	new code which may require substantial review before
	committing should be placed on a web or ftp server, and the
	URL should be included in the PR instead of the patch.
	Patches in email tend to get mangled,
	and the larger the patch, the harder it will be for
	interested parties to unmangle it.  Also, posting a patch on
	the web allows you to modify it without having to resubmit the
	entire patch in a followup to the original PR.  Finally, large
	patches simply increase the size of the database, since closed
	PRs are not actually deleted but instead kept and simply
	marked as complete.</p><p>You should also take note that unless you explicitly
	specify otherwise in your PR or in the patch itself, any
	patches you submit will be assumed to be licensed under the
	same terms as the original file you modified.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="pr-writing-filling-template"></a>4.4. Filling out the Form</h3></div></div></div><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The email address you use will become public

	    Do not overreact; refrain from labeling your problem

	    category.</p><p>The first thing you need to do is to decide what part
	    of the system your problem lies in.  Remember, FreeBSD is a
	    complete operating system, which installs both a kernel,
	    the standard libraries, many peripheral drivers, and a
	    large number of utilities (the
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">base system</span>&#8221;</span>).  However, there are thousands
	    of additional applications in the Ports Collection.
	    You'll first need to decide if the problem is in the base
	    system or something installed via the Ports
	    Collection.</p><p>Here is a description of the major categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>If a problem is with the kernel, the libraries
		(such as standard C library <code class="literal">libc</code>),
		or a peripheral driver in the base system, in general
		you will use the <code class="literal">kern</code> category.
		(There are a few exceptions; see below).  In general
		these are things that are described in section 2, 3,
		or 4 of the manual pages.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If a problem is with a binary program such as

		determine whether these programs are in the base
		system or were added via the Ports Collection.  If you
		are unsure, you can do <code class="command">whereis
		  <em class="replaceable"><code>programname</code></em></code>.
		FreeBSD's convention for the Ports Collection is to
		install everything underneath
		<code class="filename">/usr/local</code>,
		although this can be overridden by a system
		administrator.  For these, you will use the
		<code class="literal">ports</code> category (yes, even if the
		port's category is <code class="literal">www</code>; see below).
		If the location is
		<code class="filename">/bin</code>,
		<code class="filename">/usr/bin</code>,
		<code class="filename">/sbin</code>, or
		<code class="filename">/usr/sbin</code>, it
		is part of the base system, and you should use the
		<code class="literal">bin</code> category.  These are all things
		that are described in section 1 or 8 of the manual
		pages.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you believe that the error is in the startup
		<code class="literal">(rc)</code> scripts, or in some kind of
		other non-executable configuration file, then the
		right category is <code class="literal">conf</code>
		(configuration).  These are things that are described
		in section 5 of the manual pages.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have found a problem in the documentation

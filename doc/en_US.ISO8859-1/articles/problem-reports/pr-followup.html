      confirmation by email which will include the tracking number
      that was assigned to your problem report and a URL you can use
      to check its status.  With a little luck, someone will take an
      interest in your problem and try to address it, or, as the case
      may be, explain why it is not a problem.  You will be
      automatically notified of any change of status, and you will
      receive copies of any comments or patches someone may attach to
      your problem report's audit trail.</p><p>If someone requests additional information from you, or you
      remember or discover something you did not mention in the
      initial report, please submit a follow up.  The number one
      reason for a bug not getting fixed is lack of communication with
      the originator.  The easiest way is to use the comment
      option on the individual PR's web page, which you can reach
      from the <a class="link" href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/query.cgi" target="_top">PR
	search page</a>.</p><p>If the problem report remains open after the problem has
      gone away, just add a comment
      saying that the problem report can be closed, and, if
      possible, explaining how or when the problem was fixed.</p><p>Sometimes there is a delay of a week or two where the
      problem report remains untouched, not assigned or commented on
      by anyone.  This can happen when there is an increased problem
      report backlog or during a holiday season.  When a problem
      report has not received attention after several weeks, it is
      worth finding a committer particularly interested in working on
      it.</p><p>There are a few ways to do so, ideally in the following
      order, with a few days between attempting each communication
      channel:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Find the relevant FreeBSD mailing list for the problem
	  report from the <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/eresources.html#ERESOURCES-MAIL" target="_top">list
	    in the Handbook</a> and send a message to that list
	  asking about assistance or comments on the problem
	  report.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Join the relevant <acronym class="acronym">IRC</acronym> channels.
	  A partial listing is here: <a class="link" href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/IrcChannels" target="_top">https://wiki.freebsd.org/IrcChannels</a>.
	  Inform the people in that channel about the problem report
	  and ask for assistance.  Be patient and stay in the channel
	  after posting, so that the people from different time zones
	  around the world have a chance to catch up.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Find committers interested in the problem that was
	  reported.  If the problem was in a particular tool, binary,
	  port, document, or source file, check the <a class="link" href="http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org" target="_top">SVN
	    Repository</a>.  Locate the last few committers who
	  made substantive changes to the file, and try to reach them
	  via <acronym class="acronym">IRC</acronym> or email.  A list of committers
	  and their emails can be found in the <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributors" target="_top">Contributors
	    to FreeBSD</a> article.</p></li></ul></div><p>Remember that these people are volunteers, just like
      maintainers and users, so they might not be immediately
      available to assist with the problem report.  Patience and
      consistency in the follow-ups is highly advised and appreciated.
      With enough care and effort dedicated to that follow-up process,
      finding a committer to take care of the problem report is just a
      matter of time.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="pr-writing.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="pr-problems.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">4. Writing the Problem Report </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 6. If There Are Problems</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

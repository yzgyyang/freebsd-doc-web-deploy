That is great!  FreeBSD
    <span class="emphasis"><em>relies</em></span> on the contributions of its user base
    to survive.  Your contributions are not only appreciated, they are
    vital to FreeBSD's continued growth.</p><p>A large and growing number of international contributors, of
    greatly varying ages and areas of technical expertise, develop
    FreeBSD.  There is always more work to be done than there are people
    available to do it, and more help is always appreciated.</p><p>As a volunteer, what you do is limited only by what you want
    to do.  However, we do ask that you are aware of what other
    members of the FreeBSD community will expect of you.  You may want
    to take this into account before deciding to volunteer.</p><p>The FreeBSD project is responsible for an entire operating
    system environment, rather than just a kernel or a few scattered
    utilities.  As such, our <code class="filename">TODO</code> lists span a
    very wide range of tasks: from documentation, beta testing and
    presentation, to the system installer and highly specialized types
    of kernel development.  People of any skill level, in almost any
    area, can almost certainly help the project.</p><p>Commercial entities engaged in FreeBSD-related enterprises are
    also encouraged to contact us.  Do you need a special extension to
    make your product work? You will find us receptive to your
    requests, given that they are not too outlandish.  Are you working
    on a value-added product? Please let us know! We may be able to
    work cooperatively on some aspect of it.  The free software world
    is challenging many existing assumptions about how software is
    developed, sold, and maintained, and we urge you to at least give
    it a second look.</p><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="contrib-what"></a>1. What Is Needed</h2></div></div></div><p>The following list of tasks and sub-projects represents
      something of an amalgam of various <code class="filename">TODO</code>

	programmers.  The Project includes documentation writers, Web
	designers, and support people.  All that these people need to
	contribute is an investment of time and a willingness to
	learn.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Read through the FAQ and Handbook periodically.  If
	    anything is poorly explained, ambiguous, out of date or
            incorrect, let us know.  Even better, send us a fix
	    (Docbook is not difficult to learn, but there is no
	    objection to ASCII submissions).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Help translate FreeBSD documentation into your native
	    language.  If documentation already exists for your
	    language, you can help translate additional documents or
	    verify that the translations are up-to-date and correct.
	    First take a look at the <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/fdp-primer/translations.html" target="_top">Translations
	      FAQ</a> in the FreeBSD Documentation Project Primer.
	    You are not committing yourself to translating every
	    single FreeBSD document by doing this &#8212; as a
	    volunteer, you can do as much or as little translation as
	    you desire.  Once someone begins translating, others
	    almost always join the effort.  If you only have the time
	    or energy to translate one part of the documentation,
	    please translate the installation instructions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Read the <a class="link" href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions" target="_top">FreeBSD general questions mailing list</a> occasionally (or
	    even regularly).  It can be very satisfying to share your
	    expertise and help people solve their problems; sometimes
	    you may even learn something new yourself!  These forums
	    can also be a source of ideas for things to improve upon.

	  unmaintained is a great way to get involved.  Unmaintained
	  ports are only updated and fixed when somebody volunteers to
	  work on them.  There are a large number of unmaintained
	  ports.  It is a good idea to start with adopting a port that
	  you use regularly.</p><p>Unmaintained ports have their
	  <code class="varname">MAINTAINER</code> set to
	  <code class="literal">ports@FreeBSD.org</code>.  A list of unmaintained
	  ports and their current errors and problem reports can be seen
	  at the <a class="link" href="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/portsconcordanceformaintainer.py?maintainer=ports%40FreeBSD.org" target="_top">FreeBSD
	    Ports Monitoring System</a>.</p><p>Some ports affect a large number of others due to
	  dependencies and slave port relationships.  Generally, we
	  want people to have some experience before they maintain such
	  ports.</p><p>You can find out whether or not a port has dependencies
	  or slave ports by looking at a master index of ports called
	  <code class="filename">INDEX</code>.  (The name of the file varies
	  by release of FreeBSD; for instance,
	  <code class="filename">INDEX-8</code>.) Some ports have conditional
	  dependencies that are not included in a default
	  <code class="filename">INDEX</code> build.  We expect you to be able to
	  recognize such ports by looking through other ports'
	  <code class="filename">Makefile</code>s.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp47170168"></a>3.1.2. How to adopt the port</h4></div></div></div><p>First make sure you understand your

	    Handbook</a>.  <span class="emphasis"><em>Please do not commit yourself
	    to more than you feel you can comfortably
	    handle.</em></span></p><p>You may request maintainership of any unmaintained port
	  as soon as you wish.  Simply set <code class="varname">MAINTAINER</code>
	  to your own email address and send a PR (Problem Report) with
	  the change.  If the port has build errors or needs updating,
	  you may wish to include any other changes in the same PR.
	  This will help because many committers are less willing to
	  assign maintainership to someone who does not have a known
	  track record with FreeBSD.  Submitting PRs that fix build errors
	  or update ports are the best ways to establish one.</p><p>File your PR with category <code class="literal">ports</code> and
	  class <code class="literal">change-request</code>.  A committer will
	  examine your PR, commit the changes, and finally close the
	  PR.  Sometimes this process can take a little while
	  (committers are volunteers, too :).</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="maintain-port"></a>3.2. The challenge for port maintainers</h3></div></div></div><p>This section will give you an idea of why ports need to be

	  port is up to date and continues to build and run requires
	  an ongoing maintenance effort.  Maintainers are the people
	  who dedicate some of their time to meeting these goals.</p><p>The foremost reason ports need maintenance is to bring
	  the latest and greatest in third party software to the FreeBSD
	  community.  An additional challenge is to keep individual
	  ports working within the Ports Collection framework as it
	  evolves.</p><p>As a maintainer, you will need to manage the following
	  challenges:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="formalpara-title">New software versions and updates. </span>New versions and updates of existing ported

	you no longer have time to continue some (or all) of your ports
	contributions.  That is fine!  Please let us know if you are no
	longer using a port or have otherwise lost time or interest in
	being a maintainer.  In this way we can go ahead and allow other
	people to try to work on existing problems with the port without
	waiting for your response.  Remember, FreeBSD is a volunteer
	project, so if maintaining a port is no fun any more, it is
	probably time to let someone else do it!</p><p>In any case, the Ports Management Team
	(<code class="literal">portmgr</code>) reserves the right to reset your
	maintainership if you have not actively maintained your port in
	some time.  (Currently, this is set to 3 months.)  By this, we
	mean that there are unresolved problems or pending updates that
	have not been worked on during that time.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="resources"></a>3.5. Resources for ports maintainers and contributors</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook" target="_top">Porter's

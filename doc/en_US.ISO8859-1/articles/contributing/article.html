That is great!  FreeBSD
    <span class="emphasis"><em>relies</em></span> on the contributions of its user base
    to survive.  Your contributions are not only appreciated, they are
    vital to FreeBSD's continued growth.</p><p>A large and growing number of international contributors, of
    greatly varying ages and areas of technical expertise, develop
    FreeBSD.  There is always more work to be done than there are people
    available to do it, and more help is always appreciated.</p><p>As a volunteer, what you do is limited only by what you want
    to do.  However, we do ask that you are aware of what other
    members of the FreeBSD community will expect of you.  You may want
    to take this into account before deciding to volunteer.</p><p>The FreeBSD project is responsible for an entire operating
    system environment, rather than just a kernel or a few scattered
    utilities.  As such, our <code class="filename">TODO</code> lists span a
    very wide range of tasks: from documentation, beta testing and
    presentation, to the system installer and highly specialized types
    of kernel development.  People of any skill level, in almost any
    area, can almost certainly help the project.</p><p>Commercial entities engaged in FreeBSD-related enterprises are
    also encouraged to contact us.  Do you need a special extension to
    make your product work? You will find us receptive to your
    requests, given that they are not too outlandish.  Are you working
    on a value-added product? Please let us know! We may be able to
    work cooperatively on some aspect of it.  The free software world
    is challenging many existing assumptions about how software is
    developed, sold, and maintained, and we urge you to at least give
    it a second look.</p><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="contrib-what"></a>1. What Is Needed</h2></div></div></div><p>The following list of tasks and sub-projects represents

	somewhat trickier affair and depends a lot on how far out of
	date you are with the current state of FreeBSD development.
	There is a special on-going release of FreeBSD known as
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">FreeBSD-CURRENT</span>&#8221;</span> which is made available in a
	variety of ways for the convenience of developers working
	actively on the system.  See <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html" target="_top">The FreeBSD
	  Handbook</a> for more information about getting and
	using FreeBSD-CURRENT.</p><p>Working from older sources unfortunately means that your
	changes may sometimes be too obsolete or too divergent for
	easy re-integration into FreeBSD.  Chances of this can be
	minimized somewhat by subscribing to the <a class="link" href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-announce" target="_top">FreeBSD announcements mailing list</a> and the
	<a class="link" href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current" target="_top">FreeBSD-CURRENT mailing list</a> lists, where discussions on the current state of
	the system take place.</p><p>Assuming that you can manage to secure fairly up-to-date
	sources to base your changes on, the next step is to produce a
	set of diffs to send to the FreeBSD maintainers.  This is done
	with the <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">diff</span>(1)</span></a> command.</p><p>The preferred <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">diff</span>(1)</span></a> format for submitting patches

	with FreeBSD as a bug report.
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Do not</em></span> just send the
	diffs to the <a class="link" href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-hackers" target="_top">FreeBSD technical discussions mailing list</a> or they will get lost! We greatly
	appreciate your submission (this is a volunteer project!);

	immediately, but it will remain in the PR database until we
	do.  Indicate your submission by including
	<code class="literal">[PATCH]</code> in the synopsis of the

	distribution then you should send it to Core Team <code class="email">&lt;<a xmlns="" class="email" href="mailto:core@FreeBSD.org">core@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;</code> directly
	rather than submitting as a bug report.  The Core Team <code class="email">&lt;<a xmlns="" class="email" href="mailto:core@FreeBSD.org">core@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;</code>
	reaches a much smaller group of people who do much of the
	day-to-day work on FreeBSD.  Note that this group is also

	someone to host the changes for you.</p><p>When working with large amounts of code, the touchy

	prefers free software licenses such as BSD or ISC.

	  ports.  It is a good idea to start with adopting a port that
	  you use regularly.</p><p>Unmaintained ports have their
	  <code class="varname">MAINTAINER</code> set to

	  want people to have some experience before they maintain such
	  ports.</p><p>You can find out whether or not a port has dependencies
	  or slave ports by looking at a master index of ports called
	  <code class="filename">INDEX</code>.  (The name of the file varies
	  by release of FreeBSD; for instance,
	  <code class="filename">INDEX-8</code>.) Some ports have conditional
	  dependencies that are not included in a default
	  <code class="filename">INDEX</code> build.  We expect you to be able to
	  recognize such ports by looking through other ports'
	  <code class="filename">Makefile</code>s.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp45237112"></a>3.1.2. How to adopt the port</h4></div></div></div><p>First make sure you understand your

	  as soon as you wish.  Simply set <code class="varname">MAINTAINER</code>
	  to your own email address and send a PR (Problem Report) with
	  the change.  If the port has build errors or needs updating,
	  you may wish to include any other changes in the same PR.
	  This will help because many committers are less willing to
	  assign maintainership to someone who does not have a known
	  track record with FreeBSD.  Submitting PRs that fix build errors
	  or update ports are the best ways to establish one.</p><p>File your PR with category <code class="literal">ports</code> and
	  class <code class="literal">change-request</code>.  A committer will
	  examine your PR, commit the changes, and finally close the
	  PR.  Sometimes this process can take a little while

	  who dedicate some of their time to meeting these goals.</p><p>The foremost reason ports need maintenance is to bring
	  the latest and greatest in third party software to the FreeBSD
	  community.  An additional challenge is to keep individual
	  ports working within the Ports Collection framework as it
	  evolves.</p><p>As a maintainer, you will need to manage the following
	  challenges:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="formalpara-title">New software versions and updates. </span>New versions and updates of existing ported

	you no longer have time to continue some (or all) of your ports
	contributions.  That is fine!  Please let us know if you are no
	longer using a port or have otherwise lost time or interest in
	being a maintainer.  In this way we can go ahead and allow other
	people to try to work on existing problems with the port without
	waiting for your response.  Remember, FreeBSD is a volunteer
	project, so if maintaining a port is no fun any more, it is
	probably time to let someone else do it!</p><p>In any case, the Ports Management Team
	(<code class="literal">portmgr</code>) reserves the right to reset your
	maintainership if you have not actively maintained your port in
	some time.  (Currently, this is set to 3 months.)  By this, we
	mean that there are unresolved problems or pending updates that
	have not been worked on during that time.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="resources"></a>3.5. Resources for ports maintainers and contributors</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook" target="_top">Porter's

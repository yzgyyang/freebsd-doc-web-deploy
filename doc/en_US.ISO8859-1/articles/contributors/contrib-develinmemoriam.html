      existence, sadly, some of our developers have passed away.
      Here are some remembrances.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>In rough reverse chronological order of their
	passing:</em></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Bruce D. Evans (1991 - 2019; RIP 2019)</p><p>Bruce was a programming giant who made FreeBSD his
      home.</p><p>Back before FreeBSD and Linux there was Minix, a toy "unix"
      written by Andy Tannenbaum, released in 1987, sold with complete
      sources on three floppy disks, for $99.</p><p>Bruce ported Minix to the i386 around 1989.</p><p>Linus Torvalds used Minix/386 to develop his own kernel, and
      Bruce was the first person he thanked in the
      release-announcement.</p><p>When Bill Jolitz released 386BSD 0.1 in 1992, Bruce was
      listed as a contributor.</p><p>Bruce co-founded the FreeBSD project, and served on core.0,
      but he was never partisan, and over the years many other
      projects have benefitted from his patches, advice and
      wisdom.</p><p>Code reviews from Bruce came in three flavours, "mild",
      "brucified" and "brucifiction", but they were never personal: It
      was always only about the code, the mistakes, the sloppy
      thinking, the missing historical context, the ambiguous
      standards - and the style(9) transgressions.</p><p>Because Bruce gave more code reviews than anybody else in
      the history of the FreeBSD project, the commit logs hide the
      true scale of his impact until you pay attention to
      "Submitted by", "Reviewed by" and "Pointed out by".</p><p>Being hard of hearing, Bruce did not attend
      conferences.</p><p>The notable exception was the 1999 BSDcon in California,
      where his core team colleagues greeted him with "We're not
      worthy!" in Wayne's World fashion.</p><p>Twenty years later we're still not.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Kurt Lidl (2015 - 2019; RIP 2019)</p><p>Kurt first got involved with BSD while it was still a
      project at the University of California at Berkeley.  Shortly
      after personalized license plates became available in Maryland,
      he got "BSDWZRD".</p><p>He began contributing to FreeBSD shortly after the
      conception of the project.  He became a FreeBSD source committer
      in October 2015.</p><p>Kurt's most well known FreeBSD project was
      <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=blacklistd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">blacklistd</span>(8)</span></a> which blocks and releases ports on demand to
      avoid DoS abuse.  He has also made many other bug fixes and
      enhancements to DTrace, boot loaders, and other bits and pieces
      of the FreeBSD infrastructure.</p><p>Earlier work included the game XTank, an author on RFC 2516
      <a class="link" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2516" target="_top">"A Method
	for Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet (PPPoE)"</a>, and the

      very early days, contributing code to the 1.x line
      before becoming a committer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Andrey A. Chernov (1993 - 2017; RIP 2017)</p><p>Andrey contributions to FreeBSD can not be overstated. Having

      not touch.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Jürgen Lock (2006 - 2015; RIP 2015)</p><p>Jürgen made a number of contributions to FreeBSD,
      including work on libvirt, the graphics stack, and QEMU.
      Jürgen's contributions and helpfulness were appreciated by
      people around the world.  That work continues to improve the
      lives of thousands every day.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Alexander Botero-Lowry <code class="email">&lt;<a xmlns="" class="email" href="mailto:alexbl@FreeBSD.org">alexbl@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;</code> (2006 - 2011; RIP 2012)</p><p><a class="link" href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?pid=159801494" target="_top">Alexander</a>
      was best known as a major contributor to FreeBSD's
      <span class="application">Python</span> ports and a founding member of
      <a class="link" href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-python" target="_top">FreeBSD Python mailing list</a> as well as his work on
      <span class="application">XMMS2</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>John Birrell <code class="email">&lt;jb@FreeBSD.org&gt;</code> (1997 - 2009; RIP 2009)</p><p><a class="link" href="http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Community+Group+ogb/In+Memoriam" target="_top">John</a>
      made major contributions to FreeBSD, the best known of which is
      the import of the <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dtrace&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dtrace</span>(1)</span></a> code.  John's unique sense of
      humor and plain-spokenness either ruffled feathers or made him
      quick friends.  At the end of his life, he had moved to a rural
      area and was attempting to live with as minimal impact to the
      planet as possible, while at the same time still working in the
      high-tech area.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Jean-Marc Zucconi <code class="email">&lt;jmz@FreeBSD.org&gt;</code> (1994 - 2009; RIP 2009)</p><p><a class="link" href="http://www.obs-besancon.fr/article.php3?id_article=323" target="_top">Jean-Marc</a>
      was an astrophysicist who made important contributions to the
      modeling of the atmospheres of both planets and comets at
      <a class="link" href="http://www.obs-besancon.fr/" target="_top">l'Observatoire de
	Besançon</a> in Besançon, France.  While
      there, he participated in the conception and construction of the
      Vega tricanal spectrometer that studied Halley's Comet.  He had
      also been a long-time contributor to FreeBSD.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Jun-ichiro Itoh <code class="email">&lt;itojun@FreeBSD.org&gt;</code> (1997 - 2001; RIP 2008)</p><p>Known to everyone as <a class="link" href="http://astralblue.livejournal.com/350702.html" target="_top">itojun</a>,
      Jun-ichiro Hagino was a core researcher at the
      <a class="link" href="http://www.kame.net/" target="_top">KAME Project</a>,
      which aimed to provide IPv6 and IPsec technology in freely
      redistributable form.  Much of this code was incorporated into
      FreeBSD.  Without his efforts, the state of IPv6 on the Internet
      would be much different.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Cameron Grant <code class="email">&lt;cg@FreeBSD.org&gt;</code> (1999 - 2005; RIP 2005)</p><p><a class="link" href="http://www.dbsi.org/cam/" target="_top">Cameron</a>
      was a unique individual who contributed to the project despite
      serious physical disabilities.  He was responsible for a
      complete rewrite of our sound system during the late 1990s.
      Many of those who corresponded with him had no idea of his
      limited mobility, due to his cheerful spirit and willingness to
      help others.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Alan Eldridge <code class="email">&lt;alane@FreeBSD.org&gt;</code> (2002 - 2003; RIP 2003)</p><p><a class="link" href="http://freebsd.kde.org/memoriam/alane.php" target="_top">Alan</a>
      was a major contributor to the KDE on FreeBSD group.  In
      addition, he maintained many other difficult and time-consuming
      ports such as <span class="application">autoconf</span>,
      <span class="application">CUPS</span>, and
      <span class="application">python</span>.  Alan's path was not an easy
      one but his passion for FreeBSD, and dedication to programming
      excellence, won him many friends.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="contrib-portmgralumni.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="contrib-derived.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">5. Ports Management Team Alumni </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 7. Derived Software Contributors</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

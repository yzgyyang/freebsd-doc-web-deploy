      maintained by the FreeBSD project to help people who have
      questions about the normal use of FreeBSD.  Another group,
      <code class="literal">FreeBSD-hackers</code>, discusses more advanced
      questions such as future development work.</p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">hacker</span>&#8221;</span> has nothing to do with
	breaking into other people's computers.  The correct term for
	the latter activity is <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">cracker</span>&#8221;</span>, but the popular
	press has not found out yet.  The FreeBSD hackers disapprove
	strongly of cracking security, and have nothing to do with it.
	For a longer description of hackers, see Eric Raymond's <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_top">How
	  To Become A Hacker</a></p></div><p>This is a regular posting aimed to help both those seeking
      advice from FreeBSD-questions (the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">newcomers</span>&#8221;</span>),
      and also those who answer the questions (the
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">hackers</span>&#8221;</span>).</p><p>Inevitably there is some friction, which stems from the
      different viewpoints of the two groups.  The newcomers accuse
      the hackers of being arrogant, stuck-up, and unhelpful, while
      the hackers accuse the newcomers of being stupid, unable to read
      plain English, and expecting everything to be handed to them on
      a silver platter.  Of course, there is an element of truth in
      both these claims, but for the most part these viewpoints come
      from a sense of frustration.</p><p>In this document, I would like to do something to relieve
      this frustration and help everybody get better results from
      FreeBSD-questions.  In the following section, I recommend how to
      submit a question; after that, we will look at how to answer
      one.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idp44213624"></a>2. How to Subscribe to

      <code class="literal">FreeBSD-questions</code> and
      <code class="literal">FreeBSD-hackers</code>.  In some cases, it is not
      really clear which group you should ask.  The following criteria

	  <code class="literal">FreeBSD-questions</code>.  Examples might be

	  particular <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® utility.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you think the question relates to a bug, but you are

      mailing lists</a>, which caters to more specific interests.
      The criteria above still apply, and it is in your interest to
      stick to them, since you are more likely to get good results
      that way.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idp45027192"></a>5. Before Submitting a Question</h2></div></div></div><p>You can (and should) do some things yourself before asking a
      question on one of the mailing lists:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Try solving the problem on your own.  If you post a
	  question which shows that you have tried to solve the
	  problem, your question will generally attract more positive
	  attention from people reading it.  Trying to solve the
	  problem yourself will also enhance your understanding of
	  FreeBSD, and will eventually let you use your knowledge to
	  help others by answering questions posted to the mailing
	  lists.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Read the manual pages, and the FreeBSD documentation
	  (either installed in <code class="filename">/usr/doc</code> or

      the following points:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Remember that nobody gets paid for answering a FreeBSD
	  question.  They do it of their own free will.  You can
	  influence this free will positively by submitting a
	  well-formulated question supplying as much relevant
	  information as possible.  You can influence this free will
	  negatively by submitting an incomplete, illegible, or rude
	  question.  It is perfectly possible to send a message to
	  FreeBSD-questions and not get an answer even if you follow
	  these rules.  It is much more possible to not get an answer
	  if you do not.  In the rest of this document, we will look
	  at how to get the most out of your question to
	  FreeBSD-questions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Not everybody who answers FreeBSD questions reads every
	  message: they look at the subject line and decide whether it
	  interests them.  Clearly, it is in your interest to specify
	  a subject.  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">FreeBSD
	    problem</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Help</span>&#8221;</span> are not enough.  If
	  you provide no subject at all, many people will not bother
	  reading it.  If your subject is not specific enough, the
	  people who can answer it may not read it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Format your message so that it is legible, and
	  PLEASE DO NOT SHOUT!!!!!.  We appreciate that a lot of
	  people do not speak English as their first language, and we
	  try to make allowances for that, but it is really painful to
	  try to read a message written full of typos or without any
	  line breaks.</p><p>Do not underestimate the effect that a poorly formatted
	  mail message has, not just on the FreeBSD-questions mailing
	  list.  Your mail message is all people see of you, and if it
	  is poorly formatted, one line per paragraph, badly spelt, or
	  full of errors, it will give people a poor impression of
	  you.</p><p>A lot of badly formatted messages come from <a class="link" href="http://www.lemis.com/email.html" target="_top">bad
	  mailers or badly configured mailers</a>.  The following
	  mailers are known to send out badly formatted messages
	  without you finding out about them:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Eudora</span>®</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>exmh</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>® Exchange</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>® <span class="trademark">Outlook</span>®</p></li></ul></div><p>Try not to use <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym>: a lot of people
	  use mailers which do not get on very well with
	  <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure your time and time zone are set correctly.
	  This may seem a little silly, since your message still gets
	  there, but many of the people you are trying to reach get
	  several hundred messages a day.  They frequently sort the
	  incoming messages by subject and by date, and if your
	  message does not come before the first answer, they may
	  assume they missed it and not bother to look.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do not include unrelated questions in the same message.
	  Firstly, a long message tends to scare people off, and
	  secondly, it is more difficult to get all the people who can
	  answer all the questions to read the message.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Specify as much information as possible.  This is a
	  difficult area, and we need to expand on what information
	  you need to submit, but here is a start:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>In nearly every case, it is important to know the
	      version of FreeBSD you are running.  This is
	      particularly the case for FreeBSD-CURRENT, where you
	      should also specify the date of the sources, though of
	      course you should not be sending questions about
	      -CURRENT to FreeBSD-questions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>With any problem which <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be
	      hardware related, tell us about your hardware.  In case
	      of doubt, assume it is possible that it is hardware.
	      What kind of CPU are you using?  How fast?  What
	      motherboard?  How much memory?  What peripherals?</p><p>There is a judgement call here, of course, but the
	      output of the <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a> command can frequently be
	      very useful, since it tells not just what hardware you
	      are running, but what version of FreeBSD as well.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you get error messages, do not say <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">I get
		error messages</span>&#8221;</span>, say (for example) <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">I get
		the error message 'No route to host'</span>&#8221;</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If your system panics, do not say <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">My system
		panicked</span>&#8221;</span>, say (for example) <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">my system
		panicked with the message 'free vnode
		isn't'</span>&#8221;</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have difficulty installing FreeBSD, please
	      tell us what hardware you have.  In particular, it is
	      important to know the IRQs and I/O addresses of the
	      boards installed in your machine.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have difficulty getting PPP to run, describe
	      the configuration.  Which version of PPP do you use?
	      What kind of authentication do you have?  Do you have a
	      static or dynamic IP address?  What kind of messages do
	      you get in the log file?</p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>A lot of the information you need to supply is the
	  output of programs, such as <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a>, or console
	  messages, which usually appear in
	  <code class="filename">/var/log/messages</code>.  Do not try to copy
	  this information by typing it in again; it is a real pain,
	  and you are bound to make a mistake.  To send log file
	  contents, either make a copy of the file and use an editor
	  to trim the information to what is relevant, or cut and
	  paste into your message.  For the output of programs like
	  <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a>, redirect the output to a file and include
	  that.  For example,</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>dmesg &gt; /tmp/dmesg.out</code></strong></pre><p>This redirects the information to the file
	  <code class="filename">/tmp/dmesg.out</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you do all this, and you still do not get an answer,
	  there could be other reasons.  For example, the problem is
	  so complicated that nobody knows the answer, or the person
	  who does know the answer was offline.  If you do not get an
	  answer after, say, a week, it  might help to re-send the
	  message.  If you do not get an answer to your second
	  message, though, you are probably not going to get one
	  from this forum.  Resending the same message again and again
	  will only make you unpopular.</p></li></ul></div><p>To summarize, let's assume you know the answer to the
      following question (yes, it is the same one in each case).
      You choose which of these two questions you would be more

      question you have already sent.  The best way to do this is to
      reply to your original message.  This has three
      advantages:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>You include the original message text, so people will
	  know what you are talking about.  Do not forget to trim
	  unnecessary text out, though.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The text in the subject line stays the same (you did
	  remember to put one in, did you not?).  Many mailers will
	  sort messages by subject.  This helps group messages
	  together.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The message reference numbers in the header will refer
	  to the previous message.  Some mailers, such as <a class="link" href="http://www.mutt.org/" target="_top">mutt</a>, can
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>thread</em></span> messages, showing the exact
	  relationships between the messages.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idp45202680"></a>8. How to Answer a Question</h2></div></div></div><p>Before you answer a question to FreeBSD-questions,
      consider:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>A lot of the points on submitting questions also apply
	  to answering questions.  Read them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Has somebody already answered the question?  The easiest
	  way to check this is to sort your incoming mail by subject:
	  then (hopefully) you will see the question followed by any
	  answers, all together.</p><p>If somebody has already answered it, it does not
	  automatically mean that you should not send another answer.
	  But it makes sense to read all the other answers
	  first.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do you have something to contribute beyond what has
	  already been said?  In general, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Yeah, me too</span>&#8221;</span>
	  answers do not help much, although there are exceptions,
	  like when somebody is describing a problem they are having,
	  and they do not know whether it is their fault or whether
	  there is something wrong with the hardware or software.  If
	  you do send a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">me too</span>&#8221;</span> answer, you should
	  also include any further relevant information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Are you sure you understand the question?  Very
	  frequently, the person who asks the question is confused or
	  does not express themselves very well.  Even with the best
	  understanding of the system, it is easy to send a reply
	  which does not answer the question.  This does not help: you
	  will leave the person who submitted the question more
	  frustrated or confused than ever.  If nobody else answers,
	  and you are not too sure either, you can always ask for more
	  information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Are you sure your answer is correct? If not, wait a day
	  or so.  If nobody else comes up with a better answer, you
	  can still reply and say, for example, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">I do not know
	    if this is correct, but since nobody else has replied, why
	    don't you try replacing your ATAPI CDROM with a
	    frog?</span>&#8221;</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, reply to
	  the sender and to FreeBSD-questions.  Many people on the
	  FreeBSD-questions are <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">lurkers</span>&#8221;</span>: they learn by
	  reading messages sent and replied to by others.  If you take
	  a message which is of general interest off the list, you are
	  depriving these people of their information.  Be careful
	  with group replies; lots of people send messages with
	  hundreds of CCs.  If this is the case, be sure to trim the
	  Cc: lines appropriately.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include relevant text from the original message.  Trim
	  it to the minimum, but do not overdo it.  It should still be
	  possible for somebody who did not read the original message
	  to understand what you are talking about.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use some technique to identify which text came from the
	  original message, and which text you add.  I personally find
	  that prepending <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&gt; </code></span>&#8221;</span>
	  to the original message works best.  Leaving white space
	  after the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&gt; ;</code></span>&#8221;</span> and
	  leave empty lines between your text and the original text
	  both make the result more readable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Put your response in the correct place (after the text
	  to which it replies).  It is very difficult to read a thread
	  of responses where each reply comes before the text to which
	  it replies.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Most mailers change the subject line on a reply by
	  prepending a text such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Re: </span>&#8221;</span>.  If your
	  mailer does not do it automatically, you should do it
	  manually.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the submitter did not abide by format conventions
	  (lines too long, inappropriate subject line)
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>please</em></span> fix it.  In the case of an
	  incorrect subject line (such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">HELP!!??</span>&#8221;</span>),
	  change the subject line to (say) <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Re: Difficulties
	    with sync PPP (was: HELP!!??)</span>&#8221;</span>.  That way other
	  people trying to follow the thread will have less
	  difficulty following it.</p><p>In such cases, it is appropriate to say what you did and
	  why you did it, but try not to be rude.  If you find you can
	  not answer without being rude, do not answer.</p><p>If you just want to reply to a message because of its
	  bad format, just reply to the submitter, not to the list.
	  You can just send him this message in reply, if you
	  like.</p></li></ol></div></div></div></body></html>

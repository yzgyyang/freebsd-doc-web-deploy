      consider:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>A lot of the points on submitting questions also apply
	  to answering questions.  Read them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Has somebody already answered the question?  The easiest
	  way to check this is to sort your incoming mail by subject:
	  then (hopefully) you will see the question followed by any
	  answers, all together.</p><p>If somebody has already answered it, it does not
	  automatically mean that you should not send another answer.
	  But it makes sense to read all the other answers
	  first.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do you have something to contribute beyond what has
	  already been said?  In general, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Yeah, me too</span>&#8221;</span>
	  answers do not help much, although there are exceptions,
	  like when somebody is describing a problem they are having,
	  and they do not know whether it is their fault or whether
	  there is something wrong with the hardware or software.  If
	  you do send a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">me too</span>&#8221;</span> answer, you should
	  also include any further relevant information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Are you sure you understand the question?  Very
	  frequently, the person who asks the question is confused or
	  does not express themselves very well.  Even with the best
	  understanding of the system, it is easy to send a reply
	  which does not answer the question.  This does not help: you
	  will leave the person who submitted the question more
	  frustrated or confused than ever.  If nobody else answers,
	  and you are not too sure either, you can always ask for more
	  information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Are you sure your answer is correct? If not, wait a day
	  or so.  If nobody else comes up with a better answer, you
	  can still reply and say, for example, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">I do not know
	    if this is correct, but since nobody else has replied, why
	    don't you try replacing your ATAPI CDROM with a
	    frog?</span>&#8221;</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, reply to
	  the sender and to FreeBSD-questions.  Many people on the
	  FreeBSD-questions are <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">lurkers</span>&#8221;</span>: they learn by
	  reading messages sent and replied to by others.  If you take
	  a message which is of general interest off the list, you are
	  depriving these people of their information.  Be careful
	  with group replies; lots of people send messages with
	  hundreds of CCs.  If this is the case, be sure to trim the
	  Cc: lines appropriately.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include relevant text from the original message.  Trim
	  it to the minimum, but do not overdo it.  It should still be
	  possible for somebody who did not read the original message
	  to understand what you are talking about.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use some technique to identify which text came from the
	  original message, and which text you add.  I personally find
	  that prepending <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&gt; </code></span>&#8221;</span>
	  to the original message works best.  Leaving white space
	  after the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&gt; ;</code></span>&#8221;</span> and
	  leave empty lines between your text and the original text
	  both make the result more readable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Put your response in the correct place (after the text
	  to which it replies).  It is very difficult to read a thread
	  of responses where each reply comes before the text to which
	  it replies.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Most mailers change the subject line on a reply by
	  prepending a text such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Re: </span>&#8221;</span>.  If your
	  mailer does not do it automatically, you should do it
	  manually.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the submitter did not abide by format conventions
	  (lines too long, inappropriate subject line)
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>please</em></span> fix it.  In the case of an
	  incorrect subject line (such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">HELP!!??</span>&#8221;</span>),
	  change the subject line to (say) <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Re: Difficulties
	    with sync PPP (was: HELP!!??)</span>&#8221;</span>.  That way other
	  people trying to follow the thread will have less
	  difficulty following it.</p><p>In such cases, it is appropriate to say what you did and
	  why you did it, but try not to be rude.  If you find you can
	  not answer without being rude, do not answer.</p><p>If you just want to reply to a message because of its
	  bad format, just reply to the submitter, not to the list.
	  You can just send him this message in reply, if you
	  like.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s07.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> </td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">7. How to Follow up to a Question </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

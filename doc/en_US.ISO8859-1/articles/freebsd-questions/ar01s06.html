      the following points:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Remember that nobody gets paid for answering a FreeBSD
	  question.  They do it of their own free will.  You can
	  influence this free will positively by submitting a
	  well-formulated question supplying as much relevant
	  information as possible.  You can influence this free will
	  negatively by submitting an incomplete, illegible, or rude
	  question.  It is perfectly possible to send a message to
	  FreeBSD-questions and not get an answer even if you follow
	  these rules.  It is much more possible to not get an answer
	  if you do not.  In the rest of this document, we will look
	  at how to get the most out of your question to
	  FreeBSD-questions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Not everybody who answers FreeBSD questions reads every
	  message: they look at the subject line and decide whether it
	  interests them.  Clearly, it is in your interest to specify
	  a subject.  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">FreeBSD
	    problem</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Help</span>&#8221;</span> are not enough.  If
	  you provide no subject at all, many people will not bother
	  reading it.  If your subject is not specific enough, the
	  people who can answer it may not read it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Format your message so that it is legible, and
	  PLEASE DO NOT SHOUT!!!!!.  We appreciate that a lot of
	  people do not speak English as their first language, and we
	  try to make allowances for that, but it is really painful to
	  try to read a message written full of typos or without any
	  line breaks.</p><p>Do not underestimate the effect that a poorly formatted
	  mail message has, not just on the FreeBSD-questions mailing
	  list.  Your mail message is all people see of you, and if it
	  is poorly formatted, one line per paragraph, badly spelt, or
	  full of errors, it will give people a poor impression of
	  you.</p><p>A lot of badly formatted messages come from <a class="link" href="http://www.lemis.com/email.html" target="_top">bad
	  mailers or badly configured mailers</a>.  The following
	  mailers are known to send out badly formatted messages
	  without you finding out about them:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Eudora</span>®</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>exmh</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>® Exchange</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>® <span class="trademark">Outlook</span>®</p></li></ul></div><p>Try not to use <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym>: a lot of people
	  use mailers which do not get on very well with
	  <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure your time and time zone are set correctly.
	  This may seem a little silly, since your message still gets
	  there, but many of the people you are trying to reach get
	  several hundred messages a day.  They frequently sort the
	  incoming messages by subject and by date, and if your
	  message does not come before the first answer, they may
	  assume they missed it and not bother to look.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do not include unrelated questions in the same message.
	  Firstly, a long message tends to scare people off, and
	  secondly, it is more difficult to get all the people who can
	  answer all the questions to read the message.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Specify as much information as possible.  This is a
	  difficult area, and we need to expand on what information
	  you need to submit, but here is a start:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>In nearly every case, it is important to know the
	      version of FreeBSD you are running.  This is
	      particularly the case for FreeBSD-CURRENT, where you
	      should also specify the date of the sources, though of
	      course you should not be sending questions about
	      -CURRENT to FreeBSD-questions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>With any problem which <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be
	      hardware related, tell us about your hardware.  In case
	      of doubt, assume it is possible that it is hardware.
	      What kind of CPU are you using?  How fast?  What
	      motherboard?  How much memory?  What peripherals?</p><p>There is a judgement call here, of course, but the
	      output of the <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a> command can frequently be
	      very useful, since it tells not just what hardware you
	      are running, but what version of FreeBSD as well.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you get error messages, do not say <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">I get
		error messages</span>&#8221;</span>, say (for example) <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">I get
		the error message 'No route to host'</span>&#8221;</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If your system panics, do not say <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">My system
		panicked</span>&#8221;</span>, say (for example) <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">my system
		panicked with the message 'free vnode
		isn't'</span>&#8221;</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have difficulty installing FreeBSD, please
	      tell us what hardware you have.  In particular, it is
	      important to know the IRQs and I/O addresses of the
	      boards installed in your machine.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have difficulty getting PPP to run, describe
	      the configuration.  Which version of PPP do you use?
	      What kind of authentication do you have?  Do you have a
	      static or dynamic IP address?  What kind of messages do
	      you get in the log file?</p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>A lot of the information you need to supply is the
	  output of programs, such as <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a>, or console
	  messages, which usually appear in
	  <code class="filename">/var/log/messages</code>.  Do not try to copy
	  this information by typing it in again; it is a real pain,
	  and you are bound to make a mistake.  To send log file
	  contents, either make a copy of the file and use an editor
	  to trim the information to what is relevant, or cut and
	  paste into your message.  For the output of programs like
	  <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a>, redirect the output to a file and include
	  that.  For example,</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>dmesg &gt; /tmp/dmesg.out</code></strong></pre><p>This redirects the information to the file
	  <code class="filename">/tmp/dmesg.out</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you do all this, and you still do not get an answer,
	  there could be other reasons.  For example, the problem is
	  so complicated that nobody knows the answer, or the person
	  who does know the answer was offline.  If you do not get an
	  answer after, say, a week, it  might help to re-send the
	  message.  If you do not get an answer to your second
	  message, though, you are probably not going to get one
	  from this forum.  Resending the same message again and again
	  will only make you unpopular.</p></li></ul></div><p>To summarize, let's assume you know the answer to the
      following question (yes, it is the same one in each case).
      You choose which of these two questions you would be more
      prepared to answer:</p><div class="example"><a id="idp47058168"></a><div class="example-title">Example 1. Message 1</div><div class="example-contents"><pre class="literallayout">Subject: HELP!!?!??

I've just got the FreeBSD 2.1.5 CDROM from Walnut Creek, and I'm having a lot
of difficulty installing it.  I have a 66 MHz 486 with 16 MB of
memory and an Adaptec 1540A SCSI board, a 1.2GB Quantum Fireball
disk and a Toshiba 3501XA CDROM drive.  The installation works just
fine, but when I try to reboot the system, I get the message

      Internet connections (xDSL) and also because of the reduction of
      available IPv4 addresses, many companies are connected to the Internet
      24 hours on 24 and with few (sometimes not even a power of 2) IP
      addresses. In these situations it is often desirable to have a firewall
      that filters incoming and outgoing traffic from and towards Internet,
      but a packet filtering solution based on router may not be applicable,
      either due to subnetting issues, the router is owned by the connectivity
      supplier (<acronym class="acronym">ISP</acronym>), or because it does not support such
      functionalities. In these scenarios the use of a filtering bridge is
      highly advised.</p><p>A bridge-based firewall can be configured and inserted between the
      xDSL router and your Ethernet hub/switch without any IP numbering
      issues.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="filtering-bridges-how"></a>2. How to Install</h2></div></div></div><p>Adding bridge functionalities to a FreeBSD system is not difficult.
      Since 4.5 release it is possible to load such functionalities as modules
      instead of having to rebuild the kernel, simplifying the procedure a
      great deal. In the following subsections I will explain both
      installation ways.</p><div xmlns="" class="important"><h3 class="admontitle">Important: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="emphasis"><em>Do not</em></span> follow both instructions: a procedure
	<span class="emphasis"><em>excludes</em></span> the other one.  Select the best choice
	according to your needs and abilities.</p></div><p>Before going on, be sure to have at least two Ethernet cards that
      support the promiscuous mode for both reception and transmission, since
      they must be able to send Ethernet packets with any address, not just
      their own. Moreover, to have a good throughput, the cards should be PCI
      bus mastering cards. The best choices are still the Intel <span class="trademark">EtherExpress</span>&#8482;
      Pro, followed by the <span class="trademark">3Com</span>® 3c9xx series. To simplify the firewall
      configuration it may be useful to have two cards of different
      manufacturers (using different drivers) in order to distinguish clearly
      which interface is connected to the router and which to the inner
      network.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="filtering-bridges-kernel"></a>2.1. Kernel Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>So you have decided to use the older but well tested installation
	method. To begin, you have to add the following rows to your kernel
	configuration file:</p><pre class="programlisting">options BRIDGE
options IPFIREWALL
options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE</pre><p>The first line is to compile the bridge support, the second one is
	the firewall and the third one is the logging functions of the
	firewall.</p><p>Now it is necessary to build and install the new kernel.  You may
	find detailed instructions in the <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig-building.html" target="_top">Building
	and Installing a Custom Kernel</a> section of the FreeBSD
	Handbook.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="filtering-bridges-modules"></a>2.2. Modules Loading</h3></div></div></div><p>If you have chosen to use the new and simpler installation
	method, the only thing to do now is add the following row to
        <code class="filename">/boot/loader.conf</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">bridge_load="YES"</pre><p>In this way, during the system startup, the
	<code class="filename">bridge.ko</code> module will be loaded together with the
	kernel. It is not required to add a similar row for the
	<code class="filename">ipfw.ko</code> module, since it will be loaded
	automatically after the execution of the steps in the following
	section.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="filtering-bridges-finalprep"></a>3. Final Preparation</h2></div></div></div><p>Before rebooting in order to load the new kernel or the required
      modules (according to the previously chosen installation method), you
      have to make some changes to the <code class="filename">/etc/rc.conf</code>
      configuration file. The default rule of the firewall is to reject all IP
      packets.  Initially we will set up an <code class="option">open</code> firewall, in order to verify
      its operation without any issue related to packet filtering (in case you
      are going to execute this procedure remotely, such configuration will
      avoid you to remain isolated from the network). Put these lines in
      <code class="filename">/etc/rc.conf</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">firewall_enable="YES"
firewall_type="open"
firewall_quiet="YES"
firewall_logging="YES"</pre><p>The first row will enable the firewall (and will load the module
      <code class="filename">ipfw.ko</code> if it is not compiled in the kernel), the
      second one to set up it in <code class="option">open</code> mode (as explained in
      <code class="filename">/etc/rc.firewall</code>), the third one to not show rules
      loading and the fourth one to enable logging support.</p><p>About the configuration of the network interfaces, the most used way
      is to assign an IP to only one of the network cards, but the bridge will
      work equally even if both interfaces or none has a configured IP. In the
      last case (IP-less) the bridge machine will be still more hidden, as
      inaccessible from the network: to configure it, you have to login from
      console or through a third network interface separated from the bridge.
      Sometimes, during the system startup, some programs require network
      access, say for domain resolution: in this case it is necessary to
      assign an IP to the external interface (the one connected to Internet,
      where <acronym class="acronym">DNS</acronym> server resides), since the bridge will be
      activated at the end of the startup procedure. It means that the
      <code class="filename">fxp0</code> interface (in our case) must be mentioned
      in the ifconfig section of the <code class="filename">/etc/rc.conf</code> file,
      while the <code class="filename">xl0</code> is not. Assigning an IP to both
      the network cards does not make much sense, unless, during the start
      procedure, applications should access to services on both Ethernet
      segments.</p><p>There is another important thing to know. When running IP over
      Ethernet, there are actually two Ethernet protocols in use: one is IP,
      the other is <acronym class="acronym">ARP</acronym>.  <acronym class="acronym">ARP</acronym> does the
      conversion of the IP address of a host into its Ethernet address
      (<acronym class="acronym">MAC</acronym> layer).  In order to allow the communication
      between two hosts separated by the bridge, it is necessary that the
      bridge will forward <acronym class="acronym">ARP</acronym> packets. Such protocol is not
      included in the IP layer, since it exists only with IP over Ethernet.
      The FreeBSD firewall filters exclusively on the IP layer and therefore
      all non-IP packets (<acronym class="acronym">ARP</acronym> included) will be forwarded
      without being filtered, even if the firewall is configured to not permit
      anything.</p><p>Now it is time to reboot the system and use it as before: there will
      be some new messages about the bridge and the firewall, but the bridge
      will not be activated and the firewall, being in <code class="option">open</code> mode, will not
      avoid any operations.</p><p>If there are any problems, you should sort them out now
      before proceeding.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="filtering-bridges-enabling"></a>4. Enabling the Bridge</h2></div></div></div><p>At this point, to enable the bridge, you have to execute the
      following commands (having the shrewdness to replace the names of the
      two network interfaces <code class="filename">fxp0</code> and
      <code class="filename">xl0</code> with your own ones):</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.config=fxp0:0,xl0:0</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.ipfw=1</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.enable=1</code></strong></pre><p>The first row specifies which interfaces should be activated by the
      bridge, the second one will enable the firewall on the bridge and
      finally the third one will enable the bridge.</p><p>At this point you should be able to insert the machine between two
      sets of hosts without compromising any communication abilities between
      them. If so, the next step is to add the
      <code class="literal">net.link.ether.bridge.<em class="replaceable"><code>[blah]</code></em>=<em class="replaceable"><code>[blah]</code></em></code>
      portions of these rows to the <code class="filename">/etc/sysctl.conf</code>
      file, in order to have them execute at startup.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="filtering-bridges-ipfirewall"></a>5. Configuring The Firewall</h2></div></div></div><p>Now it is time to create your own file with custom firewall rules,
      in order to secure the inside network. There will be some complication
      in doing this because not all of the firewall functionalities are
      available on bridged packets. Furthermore, there is a difference between
      the packets that are in the process of being forwarded and packets that
      are being received by the local machine. In general, incoming packets
      are run through the firewall only once, not twice as is normally the
      case; in fact they are filtered only upon receipt, so rules that use
      <code class="option">out</code> or <code class="option">xmit</code> will never match. Personally, I use <code class="option">in via</code> which is an
      older syntax, but one that has a sense when you read it. Another
      limitation is that you are restricted to use only <code class="option">pass</code> or <code class="option">drop</code>
      commands for packets filtered by a bridge.  Sophisticated things like
      <code class="option">divert</code>, <code class="option">forward</code> or <code class="option">reject</code> are not available. Such options can
      still be used, but only on traffic to or from the bridge machine itself
      (if it has an IP address).</p><p>New in FreeBSD 4.0, is the concept of stateful filtering.  This is a
      big improvement for <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym> traffic, which typically is a
      request going out, followed shortly thereafter by a response with the
      exact same set of IP addresses and port numbers (but with source and
      destination reversed, of course). For firewalls that have no
      statekeeping, there is almost no way to deal with this sort of traffic
      as a single session. But with a firewall that can <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">remember</span>&#8221;</span> an outgoing
      <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym> packet and, for the next few minutes, allow a
      response, handling <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym> services is trivial. The
      following example shows how to do it. It is possible to do the same thing
      with <acronym class="acronym">TCP</acronym> packets. This allows you to avoid some
      denial of service attacks and other nasty tricks, but it also typically
      makes your state table grow quickly in size.</p><p>Let's look at an example setup. Note first that at the top of
      <code class="filename">/etc/rc.firewall</code> there are already standard rules
      for the loopback interface <code class="filename">lo0</code>, so we should not
      have to care for them anymore. Custom rules should be put in a separate
      file (say <code class="filename">/etc/rc.firewall.local</code>) and loaded at
      system startup, by modifying the row of
      <code class="filename">/etc/rc.conf</code> where we defined the <code class="option">open</code>
      firewall:</p><pre class="programlisting">firewall_type="/etc/rc.firewall.local"</pre><div xmlns="" class="important"><h3 class="admontitle">Important: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You have to specify the <span class="emphasis"><em>full</em></span> path, otherwise
	it will not be loaded with the risk to remain isolated from the
	network.</p></div><p>For our example imagine to have the <code class="filename">fxp0</code>
      interface connected towards the outside (Internet) and the
      <code class="filename">xl0</code> towards the inside
      (<acronym class="acronym">LAN</acronym>).  The bridge machine has the IP <code class="systemitem">1.2.3.4</code> (it is not possible that your
      <acronym class="acronym">ISP</acronym> can give you an address quite like this, but for
      our example it is good).</p><pre class="programlisting"># Things that we have kept state on before get to go through in a hurry

      missing. In particular, there are no anti-spoofing rules, in fact we did
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> add:</p><pre class="programlisting">add deny all from 1.2.3.4/8 to any in via fxp0</pre><p>That is, drop packets that are coming in from the outside claiming
      to be from our network. This is something that you would commonly do to
      be sure that someone does not try to evade the packet filter, by
      generating nefarious packets that look like they are from the inside.
      The problem with that is that there is <span class="emphasis"><em>at least</em></span> one
      host on the outside interface that you do not want to ignore: the
      router. But usually, the <acronym class="acronym">ISP</acronym> anti-spoofs at their
      router, so we do not need to bother that much.</p><p>The last rule seems to be an exact duplicate of the default rule,
      that is, do not let anything pass that is not specifically allowed. But
      there is a difference: all suspected traffic will be logged.</p><p>There are two rules for passing <acronym class="acronym">SMTP</acronym> and
      <acronym class="acronym">DNS</acronym> traffic towards the mail server and the name
      server, if you have them. Obviously the whole rule set should be
      flavored to personal taste, this is only a specific example (rule format
      is described accurately in the <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipfw&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">ipfw</span>(8)</span></a> man page). Note that in
      order for <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">relay</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">ns</span>&#8221;</span> to work, name service lookups must work
      <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the bridge is enabled. This is an example of
      making sure that you set the IP on the correct network card.
      Alternatively it is possible to specify the IP address instead of the
      host name (required if the machine is IP-less).</p><p>People that are used to setting up firewalls are probably also used
      to either having a <code class="option">reset</code> or a <code class="option">forward</code> rule for ident packets
      (<acronym class="acronym">TCP</acronym> port 113). Unfortunately, this is not an
      applicable option with the bridge, so the best thing is to simply pass
      them to their destination. As long as that destination machine is not
      running an ident daemon, this is relatively harmless. The alternative is
      dropping connections on port 113, which creates some problems with
      services like <acronym class="acronym">IRC</acronym> (the ident probe must
      timeout).</p><p>The only other thing that is a little weird that you may have
      noticed is that there is a rule to let the bridge machine speak, and
      another for internal hosts. Remember that this is because the two sets
      of traffic will take different paths through the kernel and into the
      packet filter. The inside net will go through the bridge, while the
      local machine will use the normal IP stack to speak. Thus the two rules
      to handle the different cases. The <code class="literal">in via
      fxp0</code> rules work for both paths. In general, if
      you use <code class="option">in via</code> rules throughout the filter, you will need to make an
      exception for locally generated packets, because they did not come in
      via any of our interfaces.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="filtering-bridges-contributors"></a>6. Contributors</h2></div></div></div><p>Many parts of this article have been taken, updated and adapted from

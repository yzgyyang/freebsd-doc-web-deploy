          This function probes if a device is present. If the driver
          supports auto-detection of some part of device configuration
          (such as interrupt vector or memory address) this
          auto-detection must be done in this routine.
        </p><p>
          As for any other bus, if the device cannot be detected or
          is detected but failed the self-test or some other problem
          happened then it returns a positive value of error. The
          value <span class="errorname">ENXIO</span> must be returned if the device is not
          present. Other error values may mean other conditions. Zero
          or negative values mean success. Most of the drivers return
          zero as success.
        </p><p>
          The negative return values are used when a PnP device
          supports multiple interfaces. For example, an older
          compatibility interface and a newer advanced interface which
          are supported by different drivers. Then both drivers would
          detect the device. The driver which returns a higher value
          in the probe routine takes precedence (in other words, the
          driver returning 0 has highest precedence, one returning -1
          is next, one returning -2 is after it and so on). In result
          the devices which support only the old interface will be
          handled by the old driver (which should return -1 from the
          probe routine) while the devices supporting the new
          interface as well will be handled by the new driver (which
          should return 0 from the probe routine).
        </p><p>
          The device descriptor struct xxx_softc is allocated by the
          system before calling the probe routine. If the probe
          routine returns an error the descriptor will be
          automatically deallocated by the system. So if a probing
          error occurs the driver must make sure that all the
          resources it used during probe are deallocated and that
          nothing keeps the descriptor from being safely
          deallocated. If the probe completes successfully the
          descriptor will be preserved by the system and later passed
          to the routine <code class="function">xxx_isa_attach()</code>. If a
          driver returns a negative value it can not be sure that it
          will have the highest priority and its attach routine will
          be called. So in this case it also must release all the
          resources before returning and if necessary allocate them
          again in the attach routine. When
          <code class="function">xxx_isa_probe()</code> returns 0 releasing the
          resources before returning is also a good idea and a
          well-behaved driver should do so. But in cases where there is
          some problem with releasing the resources the driver is
          allowed to keep resources between returning 0 from the probe
          routine and execution of the attach routine.
        </p><p>
          A typical probe routine starts with getting the device
          descriptor and unit:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">         struct xxx_softc *sc = device_get_softc(dev);
          int unit = device_get_unit(dev);
          int pnperror;
          int error = 0;

          sc-&gt;dev = dev; /* link it back */
          sc-&gt;unit = unit;        </pre><p>
          Then check for the PnP devices. The check is carried out by
          a table containing the list of PnP IDs supported by this
          driver and human-readable descriptions of the device models
          corresponding to these IDs.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
        pnperror=ISA_PNP_PROBE(device_get_parent(dev), dev,
        xxx_pnp_ids); if(pnperror == ENXIO) return ENXIO;
        </pre><p>
          The logic of ISA_PNP_PROBE is the following: If this card
          (device unit) was not detected as PnP then ENOENT will be
          returned. If it was detected as PnP but its detected ID does
          not match any of the IDs in the table then ENXIO is
          returned. Finally, if it has PnP support and it matches on
          of the IDs in the table, 0 is returned and the appropriate
          description from the table is set by
          <code class="function">device_set_desc()</code>.
        </p><p>
          If a driver supports only PnP devices then the condition
          would look like:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">          if(pnperror != 0)
              return pnperror;        </pre><p>
          No special treatment is required for the drivers which do not
          support PnP because they pass an empty PnP ID table and will
          always get ENXIO if called on a PnP card.
        </p><p>
          The probe routine normally needs at least some minimal set
          of resources, such as I/O port number to find the card and
          probe it. Depending on the hardware the driver may be able
          to discover the other necessary resources automatically. The
          PnP devices have all the resources pre-set by the PnP
          subsystem, so the driver does not need to discover them by
          itself.
        </p><p>
          Typically the minimal information required to get access to
          the device is the I/O port number. Then some devices allow
          to get the rest of information from the device configuration
          registers (though not all devices do that).  So first we try
          to get the port start value:
        </p><pre class="programlisting"> sc-&gt;port0 = bus_get_resource_start(dev,
        SYS_RES_IOPORT, 0 /*rid*/); if(sc-&gt;port0 == 0) return ENXIO;
        </pre><p>
          The base port address is saved in the structure softc for
          future use.  If it will be used very often then calling the
          resource function each time would be prohibitively slow. If
          we do not get a port we just return an error.  Some device
          drivers can instead be clever and try to probe all the
          possible ports, like this:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
          /* table of all possible base I/O port addresses for this device */
          static struct xxx_allports {
              u_short port; /* port address */
              short used; /* flag: if this port is already used by some unit */
          } xxx_allports = {
              { 0x300, 0 },
              { 0x320, 0 },
              { 0x340, 0 },
              { 0, 0 } /* end of table */
          };

          ...
          int port, i;
          ...

          port =  bus_get_resource_start(dev, SYS_RES_IOPORT, 0 /*rid*/);
          if(port !=0 ) {
              for(i=0; xxx_allports[i].port!=0; i++) {
                  if(xxx_allports[i].used || xxx_allports[i].port != port)
                      continue;

                  /* found it */
                  xxx_allports[i].used = 1;
                  /* do probe on a known port */
                  return xxx_really_probe(dev, port);
              }
              return ENXIO; /* port is unknown or already used */
          }

          /* we get here only if we need to guess the port */
          for(i=0; xxx_allports[i].port!=0; i++) {
              if(xxx_allports[i].used)
                  continue;

              /* mark as used - even if we find nothing at this port
               * at least we won't probe it in future
               */
               xxx_allports[i].used = 1;

              error = xxx_really_probe(dev, xxx_allports[i].port);
              if(error == 0) /* found a device at that port */
                  return 0;
          }
          /* probed all possible addresses, none worked */
          return ENXIO;</pre><p>
          Of course, normally the driver's
          <code class="function">identify()</code> routine should be used for
          such things. But there may be one valid reason why it may be
          better to be done in <code class="function">probe()</code>: if this
          probe would drive some other sensitive device crazy.  The
          probe routines are ordered with consideration of the
          <code class="literal">sensitive</code> flag: the sensitive devices get probed first and
          the rest of the devices later.  But the
          <code class="function">identify()</code> routines are called before
          any probes, so they show no respect to the sensitive devices
          and may upset them.
        </p><p>
          Now, after we got the starting port we need to set the port
          count (except for PnP devices) because the kernel does not
          have this information in the configuration file.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
         if(pnperror /* only for non-PnP devices */
         &amp;&amp; bus_set_resource(dev, SYS_RES_IOPORT, 0, sc-&gt;port0,
         XXX_PORT_COUNT)&lt;0)
             return ENXIO;</pre><p>
          Finally allocate and activate a piece of port address space
          (special values of start and end mean <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">use those we set by
          <code class="function">bus_set_resource()</code></span>&#8221;</span>):
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
          sc-&gt;port0_rid = 0;
          sc-&gt;port0_r = bus_alloc_resource(dev, SYS_RES_IOPORT,
          &amp;sc-&gt;port0_rid,
              /*start*/ 0, /*end*/ ~0, /*count*/ 0, RF_ACTIVE);

          if(sc-&gt;port0_r == NULL)
              return ENXIO;</pre><p>
          Now having access to the port-mapped registers we can poke
          the device in some way and check if it reacts like it is
          expected to. If it does not then there is probably some
          other device or no device at all at this address.
        </p><p>
          Normally drivers do not set up the interrupt handlers until
          the attach routine. Instead they do probes in the polling
          mode using the <code class="function">DELAY()</code> function for
          timeout. The probe routine must never hang forever, all the
          waits for the device must be done with timeouts. If the
          device does not respond within the time it is probably broken
          or misconfigured and the driver must return error. When
          determining the timeout interval give the device some extra
          time to be on the safe side: although
          <code class="function">DELAY()</code> is supposed to delay for the
          same amount of time on any machine it has some margin of
          error, depending on the exact CPU.
        </p><p>
          If the probe routine really wants to check that the
          interrupts really work it may configure and probe the
          interrupts too. But that is not recommended.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
          /* implemented in some very device-specific way */
          if(error = xxx_probe_ports(sc))
              goto bad; /* will deallocate the resources before returning */
        </pre><p>
          The function <code class="function">xxx_probe_ports()</code> may also
          set the device description depending on the exact model of
          device it discovers.  But if there is only one supported
          device model this can be as well done in a hardcoded way.
          Of course, for the PnP devices the PnP support sets the
          description from the table automatically.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">          if(pnperror)
              device_set_desc(dev, "Our device model 1234");
        </pre><p>
          Then the probe routine should either discover the ranges of
          all the resources by reading the device configuration
          registers or make sure that they were set explicitly by the
          user. We will consider it with an example of on-board
          memory. The probe routine should be as non-intrusive as
          possible, so allocation and check of functionality of the
          rest of resources (besides the ports) would be better left
          to the attach routine.
        </p><p>
          The memory address may be specified in the kernel
          configuration file or on some devices it may be
          pre-configured in non-volatile configuration registers.  If
          both sources are available and different, which one should
          be used?  Probably if the user bothered to set the address
          explicitly in the kernel configuration file they know what
          they are doing and this one should take precedence. An
          example of implementation could be:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
          /* try to find out the config address first */
          sc-&gt;mem0_p = bus_get_resource_start(dev, SYS_RES_MEMORY, 0 /*rid*/);

          Resources for IRQ and DRQ are easy to check by analogy.
        </p><p>
          If all went well then release all the resources and return success.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">          xxx_free_resources(sc);
          return 0;</pre><p>
          Finally, handle the troublesome situations. All the
          resources should be deallocated before returning. We make
          use of the fact that before the structure softc is passed to
          us it gets zeroed out, so we can find out if some resource
          was allocated: then its descriptor is non-zero.

          That would be all for the probe routine. Freeing of

      connected, the service layer switches on the port, providing the
      device with 100 mA of current.  At this point the device is in
      its default state and listening to device address 0.  The
      services layer will proceed to retrieve the various descriptors
      through the default pipe.  After that it will send a Set Address
      request to move the device away from the default device address
      (address 0).  Multiple device drivers might be able to support
      the device.  For example a modem driver might be able to support
      an ISDN TA through the AT compatibility interface.  A driver for
      that specific model of the ISDN adapter might however be able to
      provide much better support for this device.  To support this
      flexibility, the probes return priorities indicating their level
      of support.  Support for a specific revision of a product ranks
      the highest and the generic driver the lowest priority.  It
      might also be that multiple drivers could attach to one device
      if there are multiple interfaces within one configuration.  Each
      driver only needs to support a subset of the interfaces.</p><p>The probing for a driver for a newly attached device checks
      first for device specific drivers.  If not found, the probe code
      iterates over all supported configurations until a driver
      attaches in a configuration.  To support devices with multiple
      drivers on different interfaces, the probe iterates over all
      interfaces in a configuration that have not yet been claimed by
      a driver.  Configurations that exceed the power budget for the
      hub are ignored.  During attach the driver should initialise the
      device to its proper state, but not reset it, as this will make
      the device disconnect itself from the bus and restart the
      probing process for it.  To avoid consuming unnecessary
      bandwidth should not claim the interrupt pipe at attach time,
      but should postpone allocating the pipe until the file is opened
      and the data is actually used.  When the file is closed the pipe
      should be closed again, even though the device might still be
      attached.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp57319928"></a>13.4.1. Device Disconnect and Detach</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp57320568" class="indexterm"></a><p>A device driver should expect to receive errors during any
	transaction with the device.  The design of USB supports and
	encourages the disconnection of devices at any point in time.
	Drivers should make sure that they do the right thing when the
	device disappears.</p><p>Furthermore a device that has been disconnected and
	reconnected will not be reattached at the same device
	instance.  This might change in the future when more devices
	support serial numbers (see the device descriptor) or other
	means of defining an identity for a device have been
	developed.</p><p>The disconnection of a device is signaled by a hub in the
	interrupt packet delivered to the hub driver.  The status
	change information indicates which port has seen a connection
	change.  The device detach method for all device drivers for
	the device connected on that port are called and the
	structures cleaned up.  If the port status indicates that in
	the mean time a device has been connected to that port, the
	procedure for probing and attaching the device will be
	started.  A device reset will produce a disconnect-connect
	sequence on the hub and will be handled as described
	above.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="usb-dev.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="usb.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="usb-protocol.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">13.3. USB Device Information </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 13.5. USB Drivers Protocol Information</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

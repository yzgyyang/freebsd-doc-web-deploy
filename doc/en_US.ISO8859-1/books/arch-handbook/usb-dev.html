	information.  Each device has one or more configurations, of
	which one is selected during probe/attach.  A configuration
	provides power and bandwidth requirements.  Within each
	configuration there can be multiple interfaces.  A device
	interface is a collection of endpoints.  For example USB
	speakers can have an interface for the audio data (Audio
	Class) and an interface for the knobs, dials and buttons (HID
	Class).  All interfaces in a configuration are active at the
	same time and can be attached to by different drivers.  Each
	interface can have alternates, providing different quality of
	service parameters.  In for example cameras this is used to
	provide different frame sizes and numbers of frames per
	second.</p><p>Within each interface, 0 or more endpoints can be
	specified.  Endpoints are the unidirectional access points for
	communicating with a device.  They provide buffers to
	temporarily store incoming or outgoing data from the device.
	Each endpoint has a unique address within a configuration, the
	endpoint's number plus its direction.  The default endpoint,
	endpoint 0, is not part of any interface and available in all
	configurations.  It is managed by the services layer and not
	directly available to device drivers.</p><p>This hierarchical configuration information is described
	in the device by a standard set of descriptors (see section
	9.6 of the USB specification).  They can be requested through
	the Get Descriptor Request.  The services layer caches these
	descriptors to avoid unnecessary transfers on the USB bus.
	Access to the descriptors is provided through function
	calls.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Device descriptors: General information about the

	    in an interface descriptor.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>String descriptors: In the other descriptors string
	    indices are supplied for some fields.These can be used to
	    retrieve descriptive strings, possibly in multiple

	that are available through the GetDescriptor Request.</p><p>Pipes Communication to end points on a device flows
	through so-called pipes.  Drivers submit transfers to
	endpoints to a pipe and provide a callback to be called on
	completion or failure of the transfer (asynchronous transfers)
	or wait for completion (synchronous transfer).  Transfers to
	an endpoint are serialised in the pipe.  A transfer can either
	complete, fail or time-out (if a time-out has been set).
	There are two types of time-outs for transfers.  Time-outs can
	happen due to time-out on the USBbus (milliseconds).  These
	time-outs are seen as failures and can be due to disconnection
	of the device.  A second form of time-out is implemented in
	software and is triggered when a transfer does not complete
	within a specified amount of time (seconds).  These are caused
	by a device acknowledging negatively (NAK) the transferred
	packets.  The cause for this is the device not being ready to
	receive data, buffer under- or overrun or protocol
	errors.</p><p>If a transfer over a pipe is larger than the maximum
	packet size specified in the associated endpoint descriptor,
	the host controller (OHCI) or the HC driver (UHCI) will split
	the transfer into packets of maximum packet size, with the
	last packet possibly smaller than the maximum packet
	size.</p><p>Sometimes it is not a problem for a device to return less
	data than requested.  For example abulk-in-transfer to a modem
	might request 200 bytes of data, but the modem has only 5
	bytes available at that time.  The driver can set the short
	packet (SPD) flag.  It allows the host controller to accept a
	packet even if the amount of data transferred is less than
	requested.  This flag is only valid for in-transfers, as the
	amount of data to be sent to a device is always known
	beforehand.  If an unrecoverable error occurs in a device
	during a transfer the pipe is stalled.  Before any more data
	is accepted or sent the driver needs to resolve the cause of
	the stall and clear the endpoint stall condition through send
	the clear endpoint halt device request over the default pipe.
	The default endpoint should never stall.</p><p>There are four different types of endpoints and
	corresponding pipes: - Control pipe / default pipe: There is
	one control pipe per device, connected to the default endpoint
	(endpoint 0).  The pipe carries the device requests and
	associated data.  The difference between transfers over the
	default pipe and other pipes is that the protocol for the
	transfers is described in the USB specification.  These
	requests are used to reset and configure the device.  A basic
	set of commands that must be supported by each device is
	provided in chapter 9 of the USB specification.  The commands
	supported on this pipe can be extended by a device class
	specification to support additional functionality.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Bulk pipe: This is the USB equivalent to a raw
	    transmission medium.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Interrupt pipe: The host sends a request for data to
	    the device and if the device has nothing to send, it will
	    NAK the data packet.  Interrupt transfers are scheduled at
	    a frequency specified when creating the
	    pipe.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Isochronous pipe: These pipes are intended for
	    isochronous data, for example video or audio streams, with
	    fixed latency, but no guaranteed delivery.  Some support
	    for pipes of this type is available in the current
	    implementation.  Packets in control, bulk and interrupt
	    transfers are retried if an error occurs during
	    transmission or the device acknowledges the packet
	    negatively (NAK) due to for example lack of buffer space
	    to store the incoming data.  Isochronous packets are
	    however not retried in case of failed delivery or NAK of a
	    packet as this might violate the timing
	    constraints.</p></li></ul></div><p>The availability of the necessary bandwidth is calculated
	during the creation of the pipe.  Transfers are scheduled
	within frames of 1 millisecond.  The bandwidth allocation
	within a frame is prescribed by the USB specification, section
	5.6 [ 2].  Isochronous and interrupt transfers are allowed to
	consume up to 90% of the bandwidth within a frame.  Packets
	for control and bulk transfers are scheduled after all
	isochronous and interrupt packets and will consume all the
	remaining bandwidth.</p><p>More information on scheduling of transfers and bandwidth
	reclamation can be found in chapter 5 of the USB
	specification, section 1.3 of the UHCI specification, and
	section 3.4.2 of the OHCI specification.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="usb-hc.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="usb.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="usb-devprobe.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">13.2. Host Controllers </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 13.4. Device Probe and Attach</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

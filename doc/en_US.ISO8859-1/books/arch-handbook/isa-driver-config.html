	During Auto-Configuration</h2></div></div></div><a id="idp55838200" class="indexterm"></a><p>The ISA devices are described in the kernel configuration file
  	like:</p><pre class="programlisting">device xxx0 at isa? port 0x300 irq 10 drq 5
       iomem 0xd0000 flags 0x1 sensitive</pre><a id="idp56204280" class="indexterm"></a><p>The values of port, IRQ and so on are converted to the
	resource values associated with the device. They are optional,
	depending on the device's needs and abilities for
	auto-configuration. For example, some devices do not need DRQ
	at all and some allow the driver to read the IRQ setting from
	the device configuration ports. If a machine has multiple ISA
	buses the exact bus may be specified in the configuration
	line, like <code class="literal">isa0</code> or <code class="literal">isa1</code>, otherwise the device would be
	searched for on all the ISA buses.</p><p><code class="literal">sensitive</code> is a resource requesting that this device must
	be probed before all non-sensitive devices. It is supported
	but does not seem to be used in any current driver.</p><p>For legacy ISA devices in many cases the drivers are still
	able to detect the configuration parameters. But each device
	to be configured in the system must have a config line. If two
	devices of some type are installed in the system but there is
	only one configuration line for the corresponding driver, ie:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">device xxx0 at isa?</pre><p> then only
	one device will be configured.</p><p>But for the devices supporting automatic identification by
	the means of Plug-n-Play or some proprietary protocol one
	configuration line is enough to configure all the devices in
	the system, like the one above or just simply:</p><pre class="programlisting">device xxx at isa?</pre><p>If a driver supports both auto-identified and legacy
	devices and both kinds are installed at once in one machine
	then it is enough to describe in the config file the legacy
	devices only. The auto-identified devices will be added
	automatically.</p><p>When an ISA bus is auto-configured the events happen as
  	follows:</p><p>All the drivers' identify routines (including the PnP
	identify routine which identifies all the PnP devices) are
	called in random order.  As they identify the devices they add
	them to the list on the ISA bus.  Normally the drivers'
	identify routines associate their drivers with the new
	devices. The PnP identify routine does not know about the
	other drivers yet so it does not associate any with the new
	devices it adds.</p><p>The PnP devices are put to sleep using the PnP protocol to
        prevent them from being probed as legacy devices.</p><p>The probe routines of non-PnP devices marked as
        <code class="literal">sensitive</code> are called.  If probe for a device went
        successfully, the attach routine is called for it.</p><p>The probe and attach routines of all non-PNP devices are
  	called likewise.</p><p>The PnP devices are brought back from the sleep state and
        assigned the resources they request: I/O and memory address
        ranges, IRQs and DRQs, all of them not conflicting with the
        attached legacy devices.</p><p>Then for each PnP device the probe routines of all the
        present ISA drivers are called. The first one that claims the
        device gets attached.  It is possible that multiple drivers
        would claim the device with different priority; in this case, the
        highest-priority driver wins.  The probe routines must call
        <code class="function">ISA_PNP_PROBE()</code> to compare the actual PnP
        ID with the list of the IDs supported by the driver and if the
        ID is not in the table return failure. That means that
        absolutely every driver, even the ones not supporting any PnP
        devices must call <code class="function">ISA_PNP_PROBE()</code>, at
        least with an empty PnP ID table to return failure on unknown
        PnP devices.</p><p>The probe routine returns a positive value (the error
        code) on error, zero or negative value on success.</p><p>The negative return values are used when a PnP device
        supports multiple interfaces. For example, an older
        compatibility interface and a newer advanced interface which
        are supported by different drivers. Then both drivers would
        detect the device. The driver which returns a higher value in
        the probe routine takes precedence (in other words, the driver
        returning 0 has highest precedence, returning -1 is next,
        returning -2 is after it and so on). In result the devices
        which support only the old interface will be handled by the
        old driver (which should return -1 from the probe routine)
        while the devices supporting the new interface as well will be
        handled by the new driver (which should return 0 from the
        probe routine). If multiple drivers return the same value then
        the one called first wins. So if a driver returns value 0 it
        may be sure that it won the priority arbitration.</p><p>The device-specific identify routines can also assign not
        a driver but a class of drivers to the device. Then all the
        drivers in the class are probed for this device, like the case
        with PnP. This feature is not implemented in any existing
        driver and is not considered further in this document.</p><p>Because the PnP devices are disabled when probing the
        legacy devices they will not be attached twice (once as legacy
        and once as PnP).  But in case of device-dependent identify
        routines it is the responsibility of the driver to make sure
        that the same device will not be attached by the driver twice:
        once as legacy user-configured and once as
        auto-identified.</p><p>Another practical consequence for the auto-identified
        devices (both PnP and device-specific) is that the flags can
        not be passed to them from the kernel configuration file. So
        they must either not use the flags at all or use the flags
        from the device unit 0 for all the auto-identified devices or
        use the sysctl interface instead of flags.</p><p>Other unusual configurations may be accommodated by
        accessing the configuration resources directly with functions
        of families <code class="function">resource_query_*()</code> and
        <code class="function">resource_*_value()</code>. Their implementations
        are located in <code class="filename">kern/subr_bus.c</code>. The old IDE disk driver
        <code class="filename">i386/isa/wd.c</code> contains examples of such use. But the standard
        means of configuration must always be preferred. Leave parsing
        the configuration resources to the bus configuration
        code.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="isa-driver-device-t.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="isa-driver.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="isa-driver-resources.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">10.3. <code class="varname">device_t</code> Pointer </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 10.5. Resources</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

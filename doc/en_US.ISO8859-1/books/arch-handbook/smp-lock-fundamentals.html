	and atomic instructions, so this section will not include a
	lot of detail.  To put it simply, one can not go around reading
	variables without a lock if a lock is used to protect writes
	to that variable.  This becomes obvious when you consider that
	memory barriers simply determine relative order of memory
	operations; they do not make any guarantee about timing of
	memory operations.  That is, a memory barrier does not force
	the contents of a CPU's local cache or store buffer to flush.
	Instead, the memory barrier at lock release simply ensures
	that all writes to the protected data will be visible to other
	CPU's or devices if the write to release the lock is visible.
	The CPU is free to keep that data in its cache or store buffer
	as long as it wants. However, if another CPU performs an
	atomic instruction on the same datum, the first CPU must
	guarantee that the updated value is made visible to the second
	CPU along with any other operations that memory barriers may
	require.</p><p>For example, assuming a simple model where data is
	considered visible when it is in main memory (or a global
	cache), when an atomic instruction is triggered on one CPU,
	other CPU's store buffers and caches must flush any writes to
	that same cache line along with any pending operations behind
	a memory barrier.</p><p>This requires one to take special care when using an item
	protected by atomic instructions.  For example, in the sleep
	mutex implementation, we have to use an
	<code class="function">atomic_cmpset</code> rather than an
	<code class="function">atomic_set</code> to turn on the
	<code class="constant">MTX_CONTESTED</code> bit.  The reason is that we
	read the value of <code class="varname">mtx_lock</code> into a
	variable and then make a decision based on that read.
	However, the value we read may be stale, or it may change
	while we are making our decision.  Thus, when the
	<code class="function">atomic_set</code> executed, it may end up
	setting the bit on another value than the one we made the
	decision on. Thus, we have to use an
	<code class="function">atomic_cmpset</code> to set the value only if
	the value we made the decision on is up-to-date and
	valid.</p><p>Finally, atomic instructions only allow one item to be
	updated or read.  If one needs to atomically update several
	items, then a lock must be used instead.  For example, if two
	counters must be read and have values that are consistent
	relative to each other, then those counters must be protected
	by a lock rather than by separate atomic instructions.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp55773560"></a>8.2.2. Read Locks Versus Write Locks</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp55798776" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp55799288" class="indexterm"></a><p>Read locks do not need to be as strong as write locks.
	Both types of locks need to ensure that the data they are
	accessing is not stale.  However, only write access requires
	exclusive access.  Multiple threads can safely read a value.
	Using different types of locks for reads and writes can be
	implemented in a number of ways.</p><p>First, sx locks can be used in this manner by using an
	exclusive lock when writing and a shared lock when reading.
	This method is quite straightforward.</p><p>A second method is a bit more obscure.  You can protect a
	datum with multiple locks.  Then for reading that data you
	simply need to have a read lock of one of the locks.  However,
	to write to the data, you need to have a write lock of all of
	the locks.  This can make writing rather expensive but can be
	useful when data is accessed in various ways.  For example,
	the parent process pointer is protected by both the
	<code class="varname">proctree_lock</code> sx lock and the per-process
	mutex.  Sometimes the proc lock is easier as we are just
	checking to see who a parent of a process is that we already
	have locked.  However, other places such as
	<code class="function">inferior</code> need to walk the tree of
	processes via parent pointers and locking each process would
	be prohibitive as well as a pain to guarantee that the
	condition you are checking remains valid for both the check
	and the actions taken as a result of the check.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp55801848"></a>8.2.3. Locking Conditions and Results</h3></div></div></div><p>If you need a lock to check the state of a variable so
	that you can take an action based on the state you read, you
	can not just hold the lock while reading the variable and then
	drop the lock before you act on the value you read.  Once you
	drop the lock, the variable can change rendering your decision
	invalid. Thus, you must hold the lock both while reading the
	variable and while performing the action as a result of the
	test.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="smp.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="smp.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="smp-design.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 8. SMPng Design Document </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 8.3. General Architecture and Design</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

        device through the memory. Two variants are possible:</p><p>(a) memory is located on the device card</p><p>(b) memory is the main memory of the computer</p><p>In case (a) the driver always copies the data back and
        forth between the on-card memory and the main memory as
        necessary. To map the on-card memory into the kernel virtual
        address space the physical address and length of the on-card
        memory must be defined as a <code class="literal">SYS_RES_MEMORY</code> resource. That
        resource can then be allocated and activated, and its virtual
        address obtained using
        <code class="function">rman_get_virtual()</code>.  The older drivers
        used the function <code class="function">pmap_mapdev()</code> for this
        purpose, which should not be used directly any more. Now it is
        one of the internal steps of resource activation.</p><p>Most of the ISA cards will have their memory configured
        for physical location somewhere in range 640KB-1MB. Some of
        the ISA cards require larger memory ranges which should be
        placed somewhere under 16MB (because of the 24-bit address
        limitation on the ISA bus). In that case if the machine has
        more memory than the start address of the device memory (in
        other words, they overlap) a memory hole must be configured at
        the address range used by devices. Many BIOSes allow
        configuration of a memory hole of 1MB starting at 14MB or
        15MB. FreeBSD can handle the memory holes properly if the BIOS
        reports them properly (this feature may be broken on old BIOSes).</p><p>In case (b) just the address of the data is sent to
        the device, and the device uses DMA to actually access the
        data in the main memory. Two limitations are present: First,
        ISA cards can only access memory below 16MB.  Second, the
        contiguous pages in virtual address space may not be
        contiguous in physical address space, so the device may have
        to do scatter/gather operations. The bus subsystem provides
        ready solutions for some of these problems, the rest has to be
        done by the drivers themselves.</p><p>Two structures are used for DMA memory allocation,
        <code class="varname">bus_dma_tag_t</code> and <code class="varname">bus_dmamap_t</code>. Tag describes the properties
        required for the DMA memory. Map represents a memory block
        allocated according to these properties. Multiple maps may be
        associated with the same tag.</p><p>Tags are organized into a tree-like hierarchy with
        inheritance of the properties. A child tag inherits all the
        requirements of its parent tag, and may make them more strict
        but never more loose.</p><p>Normally one top-level tag (with no parent) is created for
        each device unit.  If multiple memory areas with different
        requirements are needed for each device then a tag for each of
        them may be created as a child of the parent tag.</p><p>The tags can be used to create a map in two ways.</p><p>First, a chunk of contiguous memory conformant with the
        tag requirements may be allocated (and later may be
        freed). This is normally used to allocate relatively
        long-living areas of memory for communication with the
        device. Loading of such memory into a map is trivial: it is
        always considered as one chunk in the appropriate physical
        memory range.</p><p>Second, an arbitrary area of virtual memory may be loaded
        into a map. Each page of this memory will be checked for
        conformance to the map requirement.  If it conforms then it is
        left at its original location. If it is not then a fresh
        conformant <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bounce page</span>&#8221;</span> is allocated and used as intermediate
        storage. When writing the data from the non-conformant
        original pages they will be copied to their bounce pages first
        and then transferred from the bounce pages to the device. When
        reading the data would go from the device to the bounce pages
        and then copied to their non-conformant original pages. The
        process of copying between the original and bounce pages is
        called synchronization. This is normally used on a per-transfer
        basis: buffer for each transfer would be loaded, transfer done
        and buffer unloaded.</p><p>The functions working on the DMA memory are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><code class="function">int bus_dma_tag_create(bus_dma_tag_t parent,

          As of now PREREAD and POSTWRITE are null operations but that
          may change in the future, so they must not be ignored in the
          driver. Synchronization is not needed for the memory
          obtained from <code class="function">bus_dmamem_alloc()</code>.
        </p><p>
          Before calling the callback function from
          <code class="function">bus_dmamap_load()</code> the segment array is
          stored in the stack. And it gets pre-allocated for the
          maximal number of segments allowed by the tag. Because of
          this the practical limit for the number of segments on i386
          architecture is about 250-300 (the kernel stack is 4KB minus
          the size of the user structure, size of a segment array
          entry is 8 bytes, and some space must be left). Because the
          array is allocated based on the maximal number this value
          must not be set higher than really needed. Fortunately, for
          most of hardware the maximal supported number of segments is
          much lower. But if the driver wants to handle buffers with a
          very large number of scatter-gather segments it should do
          that in portions: load part of the buffer, transfer it to
          the device, load next part of the buffer, and so on.
        </p><p>
          Another practical consequence is that the number of segments
          may limit the size of the buffer. If all the pages in the
          buffer happen to be physically non-contiguous then the
          maximal supported buffer size for that fragmented case would
          be (nsegments * page_size). For example, if a maximal number
          of 10 segments is supported then on i386 maximal guaranteed
          supported buffer size would be 40K. If a higher size is
          desired then special tricks should be used in the driver.
        </p><p>
          If the hardware does not support scatter-gather at all or
          the driver wants to support some buffer size even if it is
          heavily fragmented then the solution is to allocate a
          contiguous buffer in the driver and use it as intermediate
          storage if the original buffer does not fit.
        </p><p>
          Below are the typical call sequences when using a map depend
          on the use of the map.  The characters -&gt; are used to show
          the flow of time.
        </p><p>
          For a buffer which stays practically fixed during all the
          time between attachment and detachment of a device:</p><p>
          bus_dmamem_alloc -&gt; bus_dmamap_load -&gt; ...use buffer... -&gt;
          -&gt; bus_dmamap_unload -&gt; bus_dmamem_free
        </p><p>For a buffer that changes frequently and is passed from
        outside the driver:

	
        </p><pre class="programlisting">          bus_dmamap_create -&gt;
          -&gt; bus_dmamap_load -&gt; bus_dmamap_sync(PRE...) -&gt; do transfer -&gt;
          -&gt; bus_dmamap_sync(POST...) -&gt; bus_dmamap_unload -&gt;
          ...
          -&gt; bus_dmamap_load -&gt; bus_dmamap_sync(PRE...) -&gt; do transfer -&gt;
          -&gt; bus_dmamap_sync(POST...) -&gt; bus_dmamap_unload -&gt;
          -&gt; bus_dmamap_destroy        </pre><p>

        </p><p>
          When loading a map created by
          <code class="function">bus_dmamem_alloc()</code> the passed address
          and size of the buffer must be the same as used in
          <code class="function">bus_dmamem_alloc()</code>. In this case it is
          guaranteed that the whole buffer will be mapped as one
          segment (so the callback may be based on this assumption)
          and the request will be executed immediately (EINPROGRESS
          will never be returned).  All the callback needs to do in
          this case is to save the physical address.
        </p><p>
          A typical example would be:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">          static void
        alloc_callback(void *arg, bus_dma_segment_t *seg, int nseg, int error)
        {
          *(bus_addr_t *)arg = seg[0].ds_addr;
        }

          ...
          int error;
          struct somedata {
            ....
          };
          struct somedata *vsomedata; /* virtual address */
          bus_addr_t psomedata; /* physical bus-relative address */
          bus_dma_tag_t tag_somedata;
          bus_dmamap_t map_somedata;
          ...

          error=bus_dma_tag_create(parent_tag, alignment,
           boundary, lowaddr, highaddr, /*filter*/ NULL, /*filterarg*/ NULL,
           /*maxsize*/ sizeof(struct somedata), /*nsegments*/ 1,
           /*maxsegsz*/ sizeof(struct somedata), /*flags*/ 0,
           &amp;tag_somedata);
          if(error)
          return error;

          error = bus_dmamem_alloc(tag_somedata, &amp;vsomedata, /* flags*/ 0,
             &amp;map_somedata);
          if(error)
             return error;

          bus_dmamap_load(tag_somedata, map_somedata, (void *)vsomedata,
             sizeof (struct somedata), alloc_callback,
             (void *) &amp;psomedata, /*flags*/0);        </pre><p>
          Looks a bit long and complicated but that is the way to do
          it. The practical consequence is: if multiple memory areas
          are allocated always together it would be a really good idea
          to combine them all into one structure and allocate as one
          (if the alignment and boundary limitations permit).
        </p><p>
          When loading an arbitrary buffer into the map created by
          <code class="function">bus_dmamap_create()</code> special measures
          must be taken to synchronize with the callback in case it
          would be delayed. The code would look like:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">          {
           int s;
           int error;

           s = splsoftvm();
           error = bus_dmamap_load(
               dmat,
               dmamap,
               buffer_ptr,
               buffer_len,
               callback,
               /*callback_arg*/ buffer_descriptor,
               /*flags*/0);
           if (error == EINPROGRESS) {
               /*
                * Do whatever is needed to ensure synchronization
                * with callback. Callback is guaranteed not to be started
                * until we do splx() or tsleep().
                */
              }
           splx(s);
          }        </pre><p>
          Two possible approaches for the processing of requests are:
        </p><p>
          1. If requests are completed by marking them explicitly as
          done (such as the CAM requests) then it would be simpler to
          put all the further processing into the callback driver
          which would mark the request when it is done. Then not much
          extra synchronization is needed. For the flow control
          reasons it may be a good idea to freeze the request queue
          until this request gets completed.
        </p><p>
          2. If requests are completed when the function returns (such
          as classic read or write requests on character devices) then
          a synchronization flag should be set in the buffer
          descriptor and <code class="function">tsleep()</code> called.  Later
          when the callback gets called it will do its processing and
          check this synchronization flag. If it is set then the
          callback should issue a wakeup. In this approach the
          callback function could either do all the needed processing
          (just like the previous case) or simply save the segments
          array in the buffer descriptor. Then after callback
          completes the calling function could use this saved segments
          array and do all the processing.

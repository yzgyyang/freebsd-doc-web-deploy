      bus architecture based on abstraction layers which saw its
      introduction in FreeBSD 3.0 when the Alpha port was imported
      into the source tree.  It was not until 4.0 before it became the
      default system to use for device drivers.  Its goals are to
      provide a more object-oriented means of interconnecting the
      various busses and devices which a host system provides to the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Operating System</em></span>.</p><p>Its main features include amongst others:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>dynamic attaching</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>easy modularization of drivers</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>pseudo-busses</p></li></ul></div><p>One of the most prominent changes is the migration from the
      flat and ad-hoc system to a device tree layout.</p><p>At the top level resides the
      <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">root</span>&#8221;</span></em></span> device which is the
      parent to hang all other devices on.  For each architecture,
      there is typically a single child of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">root</span>&#8221;</span> which
      has such things as <span class="emphasis"><em>host-to-PCI bridges</em></span>,
      etc. attached to it.  For x86, this <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">root</span>&#8221;</span> device
      is the <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">nexus</span>&#8221;</span></em></span> device.  For
      Alpha, various different models of Alpha have
      different top-level devices corresponding to the different
      hardware chipsets, including <span class="emphasis"><em>lca</em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>apecs</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>cia</em></span> and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>tsunami</em></span>.</p><p>A device in the Newbus context represents a single hardware
      entity in the system.  For instance each PCI device is
      represented by a Newbus device.  Any device in the system can
      have children; a device which has children is often called a
      <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bus</span>&#8221;</span></em></span>.  Examples of common
      busses in the system are ISA and PCI, which manage lists of
      devices attached to ISA and PCI busses respectively.</p><p>Often, a connection between different kinds of bus is
      represented by a <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bridge</span>&#8221;</span></em></span>
      device, which normally has one child for the attached bus.  An
      example of this is a <span class="emphasis"><em>PCI-to-PCI bridge</em></span>
      which is represented by a device
      <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">pcibN</code></em></span> on the
      parent PCI bus and has a child
      <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">pciN</code></em></span> for the
      attached bus.  This layout simplifies the implementation of the
      PCI bus tree, allowing common code to be used for both top-level
      and bridged busses.</p><p>Each device in the Newbus architecture asks its parent to
      map its resources.  The parent then asks its own parent until
      the nexus is reached.  So, basically the nexus is the only part
      of the Newbus system which knows about all resources.</p><div xmlns="" class="tip"><h3 class="admontitle">Tip: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An ISA device might want to map its IO port at
      <code class="literal">0x230</code>, so it asks its parent, in this case
      the ISA bus.  The ISA bus hands it over to the PCI-to-ISA bridge
      which in its turn asks the PCI bus, which reaches the
      host-to-PCI bridge and finally the nexus.  The beauty of this
      transition upwards is that there is room to translate the
      requests.  For example, the <code class="literal">0x230</code> IO port
      request might become memory-mapped at
      <code class="literal">0xb0000230</code> on a <acronym class="acronym">MIPS</acronym> box
      by the PCI bridge.</p></div><p>Resource allocation can be controlled at any place in the
      device tree.  For instance on many Alpha platforms, ISA
      interrupts are managed separately from PCI interrupts and
      resource allocations for ISA interrupts are managed by the
      Alpha's ISA bus device.  On IA-32, ISA and PCI interrupts are
      both managed by the top-level nexus device.  For both ports,
      memory and port address space is managed by a single entity -
      nexus for IA-32 and the relevant chipset driver on Alpha (e.g.,
      CIA or tsunami).</p><p>In order to normalize access to memory and port mapped
      resources, Newbus integrates the <code class="literal">bus_space</code>
      APIs from NetBSD. These provide a single API to replace inb/outb
      and direct memory reads/writes.  The advantage of this is that a
      single driver can easily use either memory-mapped registers or
      port-mapped registers (some hardware supports both).</p><p>This support is integrated into the resource allocation
      mechanism.  When a resource is allocated, a driver can retrieve
      the associated <code class="varname">bus_space_tag_t</code> and <code class="varname">bus_space_handle_t</code> from the
      resource.</p><p>Newbus also allows for definitions of interface methods in
      files dedicated to this purpose.  These are the
      <code class="filename">.m</code> files that are found under the
      <code class="filename">src/sys</code> hierarchy.</p><p>The core of the Newbus system is an extensible
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">object-based programming</span>&#8221;</span> model.  Each device in
      the system has a table of methods which it supports.  The system
      and other devices uses those methods to control the device and
      request services.  The different methods supported by a device
      are defined by a number of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">interfaces</span>&#8221;</span>.  An
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">interface</span>&#8221;</span> is simply a group of related methods
      which can be implemented by a device.</p><p>In the Newbus system, the methods for a device are provided
      by the various device drivers in the system.  When a device is
      attached to a driver during
      <span class="emphasis"><em>auto-configuration</em></span>, it uses the method
      table declared by the driver.  A device can later
      <span class="emphasis"><em>detach</em></span> from its driver and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>re-attach</em></span> to a new driver with a new method
      table.  This allows dynamic replacement of drivers which can be
      useful for driver development.</p><p>The interfaces are described by an interface definition
      language similar to the language used to define vnode operations
      for file systems.  The interface would be stored in a methods
      file (which would normally be named
      <code class="filename">foo_if.m</code>).</p><div class="example"><a id="idp57434360"></a><div class="example-title">Example 14.1. Newbus Methods</div><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">      # Foo subsystem/driver (a comment...)

      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="filename">foo_if.h</code></span>&#8221;</span> which contains
      function declarations:</p><pre class="programlisting">      int FOO_DOIT(device_t dev);
      int FOO_DOIT_TO_CHILD(device_t dev, device_t child);</pre><p>A source file, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="filename">foo_if.c</code></span>&#8221;</span>
      is also created to accompany the automatically generated header
      file; it contains implementations of those functions which look
      up the location of the relevant functions in the object's method
      table and call that function.</p><p>The system defines two main interfaces.  The first
      fundamental interface is called
      <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">device</span>&#8221;</span></em></span> and includes methods
      which are relevant to all devices.  Methods in the
      <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">device</span>&#8221;</span></em></span> interface include
      <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">probe</span>&#8221;</span></em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">attach</span>&#8221;</span></em></span> and
      <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">detach</span>&#8221;</span></em></span> to control detection
      of hardware and <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">shutdown</span>&#8221;</span></em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">suspend</span>&#8221;</span></em></span> and
      <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">resume</span>&#8221;</span></em></span> for critical event
      notification.</p><p>The second, more complex interface is
      <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bus</span>&#8221;</span></em></span>.  This interface
      contains methods suitable for devices which have children,
      including methods to access bus specific per-device information
      <a href="#ftn.idp57459320" class="footnote" id="idp57459320"><sup class="footnote">[10]</sup></a>, event
      notification
      (<span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">child_detached</code></em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">driver_added</code></em></span>) and
      resource management
      (<span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">alloc_resource</code></em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">activate_resource</code></em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">deactivate_resource</code></em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">release_resource</code></em></span>).</p><p>Many methods in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bus</span>&#8221;</span> interface are
      performing services for some child of the bus device.  These
      methods would normally use the first two arguments to specify
      the bus providing the service and the child device which is
      requesting the service.  To simplify driver code, many of these
      methods have accessor functions which lookup the parent and call
      a method on the parent.  For instance the method
      <code class="literal">BUS_TEARDOWN_INTR(device_t dev, device_t child,
	...)</code> can be called using the function
      <code class="literal">bus_teardown_intr(device_t child,
	...)</code>.</p><p>Some bus types in the system define additional interfaces to
      provide access to bus-specific functionality.  For instance, the
      PCI bus driver defines the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pci</span>&#8221;</span> interface which
      has two methods
      <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">read_config</code></em></span> and
      <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">write_config</code></em></span> for
      accessing the configuration registers of a PCI device.</p><div class="footnotes"><br /><hr class="footnote-hr" /><div id="ftn.idp57459320" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idp57459320" class="para"><sup class="para">[10] </sup></a><a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bus_generic_read_ivar&amp;sektion=9&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">bus_generic_read_ivar</span>(9)</span></a> and

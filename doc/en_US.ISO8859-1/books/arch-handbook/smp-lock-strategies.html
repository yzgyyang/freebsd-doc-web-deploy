	internal credential structure, and is generally used as the
	basis for process-driven access control within the kernel.
	BSD-derived systems use a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">copy-on-write</span>&#8221;</span> model
	for credential data: multiple references may exist for a
	credential structure, and when a change needs to be made, the
	structure is duplicated, modified, and then the reference
	replaced.  Due to wide-spread caching of the credential to
	implement access control on open, this results in substantial
	memory savings.  With a move to fine-grained SMP, this model
	also saves substantially on locking operations by requiring
	that modification only occur on an unshared credential,
	avoiding the need for explicit synchronization when consuming
	a known-shared credential.</p><p>Credential structures with a single reference are
	considered mutable; shared credential structures must not be
	modified or a race condition is risked.  A mutex,
	<code class="varname">cr_mtxp</code> protects the reference
	count of <code class="varname">struct ucred</code> so as to
	maintain consistency.  Any use of the structure requires a
	valid reference for the duration of the use, or the structure
	may be released out from under the illegitimate
	consumer.</p><p>The <code class="varname">struct ucred</code> mutex is a leaf
	mutex and is implemented via a mutex pool for performance
	reasons.</p><p>Usually, credentials are used in a read-only manner for access
	control decisions, and in this case
	<code class="varname">td_ucred</code> is generally preferred
	because it requires no locking.  When a process' credential is
	updated the <code class="literal">proc</code> lock must be held across
	the check and update operations thus avoid races.  The process
	credential <code class="varname">p_ucred</code> must be used for
	check and update operations to prevent time-of-check,
	time-of-use races.</p><p>If system call invocations will perform access control after
	an update to the process credential, the value of
	<code class="varname">td_ucred</code> must also be refreshed to
	the current process value.  This will prevent use of a stale
	credential following a change.  The kernel automatically
	refreshes the <code class="varname">td_ucred</code> pointer in
	the thread structure from the process
	<code class="varname">p_ucred</code> whenever a process enters
	the kernel, permitting use of a fresh credential for kernel
	access control.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp55892984"></a>8.4.2. File Descriptors and File Descriptor Tables</h3></div></div></div><p>Details to follow.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp55894136"></a>8.4.3. Jail Structures</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp55894776" class="indexterm"></a><p><code class="varname">struct prison</code> stores

	per-jail hostname, IP address, and related settings.  This
	structure is reference-counted since pointers to instances of
	the structure are shared by many credential structures.  A
	single mutex, <code class="varname">pr_mtx</code> protects read
	and write access to the reference count and all mutable
	variables inside the struct jail.  Some variables are set only
	when the jail is created, and a valid reference to the
	<code class="varname">struct prison</code> is sufficient to read
	these values.  The precise locking of each entry is documented
	via comments in <code class="filename">sys/jail.h</code>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp55898360"></a>8.4.4. MAC Framework</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp55899000" class="indexterm"></a><p>The TrustedBSD MAC Framework maintains data in a variety
	of kernel objects, in the form of <code class="varname">struct
	label</code>.  In general, labels in kernel objects
	are protected by the same lock as the remainder of the kernel
	object.  For example, the <code class="varname">v_label</code>
	label in <code class="varname">struct vnode</code> is protected
	by the vnode lock on the vnode.</p><p>In addition to labels maintained in standard kernel objects,
	the MAC Framework also maintains a list of registered and
	active policies.  The policy list is protected by a global
	mutex (<code class="varname">mac_policy_list_lock</code>) and a busy
	count (also protected by the mutex).  Since many access
	control checks may occur in parallel, entry to the framework
	for a read-only access to the policy list requires holding the
	mutex while incrementing (and later decrementing) the busy
	count.  The mutex need not be held for the duration of the
	MAC entry operation--some operations, such as label operations
	on file system objects--are long-lived.  To modify the policy
	list, such as during policy registration and de-registration,
	the mutex must be held and the reference count must be zero,
	to prevent modification of the list while it is in use.</p><p>A condition variable,
	<code class="varname">mac_policy_list_not_busy</code>, is available to
	threads that need to wait for the list to become unbusy, but
	this condition variable must only be waited on if the caller is
	holding no other locks, or a lock order violation may be
	possible.  The busy count, in effect, acts as a form of
	shared/exclusive lock over access to the framework: the difference
	is that, unlike with an sx lock, consumers waiting for the list
	to become unbusy may be starved, rather than permitting lock
	order problems with regards to the busy count and other locks
	that may be held on entry to (or inside) the MAC Framework.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp55903096"></a>8.4.5. Modules</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp55903736" class="indexterm"></a><p>For the module subsystem there exists a single lock that is
	used to protect the shared data.  This lock is a shared/exclusive
	(SX) lock and has a good chance of needing to be acquired (shared
	or exclusively), therefore there are a few macros that have been
	added to make access to the lock more easy.  These macros can be
	located in <code class="filename">sys/module.h</code> and are quite basic
	in terms of usage.  The main structures protected under this lock
	are the <code class="varname">module_t</code> structures (when shared)
	and the global <code class="varname">modulelist_t</code> structure,
	modules.  One should review the related source code in
	<code class="filename">kern/kern_module.c</code> to further understand the
	locking strategy.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp55906552"></a>8.4.6. Newbus Device Tree</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp55907192" class="indexterm"></a><p>The newbus system will have one sx lock.  Readers will
	hold a shared (read) lock (<a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sx_slock&amp;sektion=9&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sx_slock</span>(9)</span></a>) and writers will hold

	will not do locking at all.  Externally visible ones will lock as
	needed.
	Those items that do not matter if the race is won or lost will
	not be locked, since they tend to be read all over the place
	(e.g., <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=device_get_softc&amp;sektion=9&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">device_get_softc</span>(9)</span></a>).  There will be relatively few

	of a SIGIO signal to its process group when the read/write
	status of specified file descriptors changes.  At most one
	process or process group is permitted to register for SIGIO
	from any given kernel object, and that process or group is
	referred to as the owner.  Each object supporting SIGIO
	registration contains pointer field that is
	<code class="constant">NULL</code> if the object is not registered, or
	points to a <code class="varname">struct sigio</code> describing
	the registration.  This field is protected by a global mutex,
	<code class="varname">sigio_lock</code>.  Callers to SIGIO maintenance
	functions must pass in this field <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">by reference</span>&#8221;</span>
	so that local register copies of the field are not made when
	unprotected by the lock.</p><p>One <code class="varname">struct sigio</code> is allocated for
	each registered object associated with any process or process
	group, and contains back-pointers to the object, owner, signal
	information, a credential, and the general disposition of the
	registration.  Each process or progress group contains a list of
	registered <code class="varname">struct sigio</code> structures,
	<code class="varname">p_sigiolst</code> for processes, and
	<code class="varname">pg_sigiolst</code> for process groups.
	These lists are protected by the process or process group
	locks respectively.  Most fields in each <code class="varname">struct
	sigio</code> are constant for the duration of the
	registration, with the exception of the
	<code class="varname">sio_pgsigio</code> field which links the
	<code class="varname">struct sigio</code> into the process or
	process group list.  Developers implementing new kernel
	objects supporting SIGIO will, in general, want to avoid
	holding structure locks while invoking SIGIO supporting
	functions, such as <code class="function">fsetown</code>
	or <code class="function">funsetown</code> to avoid
	defining a lock order between structure locks and the global
	SIGIO lock.  This is generally possible through use of an
	elevated reference count on the structure, such as reliance
	on a file descriptor reference to a pipe during a pipe
	operation.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp55930488"></a>8.4.12. Sysctl</h3></div></div></div><p>The <code class="function">sysctl</code> MIB service is invoked
	from both within the kernel and from userland applications
	using a system call.  At least two issues are raised in
	locking: first, the protection of the structures maintaining
	the namespace, and second, interactions with kernel variables
	and functions that are accessed by the sysctl interface.
	Since sysctl permits the direct export (and modification) of
	kernel statistics and configuration parameters, the sysctl
	mechanism must become aware of appropriate locking semantics
	for those variables.  Currently, sysctl makes use of a single
	global sx lock to serialize use of
	<code class="function">sysctl</code>; however, it is assumed to operate
	under Giant and other protections are not provided.  The
	remainder of this section speculates on locking and semantic
	changes to sysctl.</p><p>- Need to change the order of operations for sysctl's that
	update values from read old, copyin and copyout, write new to
	copyin, lock, read old and write new, unlock, copyout.  Normal
	sysctl's that just copyout the old value and set a new value
	that they copyin may still be able to follow the old model.
	However, it may be cleaner to use the second model for all of
	the sysctl handlers to avoid lock operations.</p><p>- To allow for the common case, a sysctl could embed a
	pointer to a mutex in the SYSCTL_FOO macros and in the struct.
	This would work for most sysctl's.  For values protected by sx
	locks, spin mutexes, or other locking strategies besides a
	single sleep mutex, SYSCTL_PROC nodes could be used to get the
	locking right.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp55933176"></a>8.4.13. Taskqueue</h3></div></div></div><p> The taskqueue's interface has two basic locks associated
	with it in order to protect the related shared data.  The
	<code class="varname">taskqueue_queues_mutex</code> is meant to serve as a
	lock to protect the <code class="varname">taskqueue_queues</code> TAILQ.
	The other mutex lock associated with this system is the one in the
	<code class="varname">struct taskqueue</code> data structure.  The
	use of the synchronization primitive here is to protect the
	integrity of the data in the <code class="varname">struct
	taskqueue</code>.  It should be noted that there are no
	separate macros to assist the user in locking down his/her own work
	since these locks are most likely not going to be used outside of
	<code class="filename">kern/subr_taskqueue.c</code>.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="smp-design.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="smp.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="smp-implementation-notes.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">8.3. General Architecture and Design </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 8.5. Implementation Notes</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

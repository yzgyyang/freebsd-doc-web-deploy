      packets on the bus.  Frames of 1 millisecond are used.  At the
      start of each frame the host controller generates a Start of
      Frame (SOF) packet.</p><p>The SOF packet is used to synchronise to the start of the
      frame and to keep track of the frame number.  Within each frame
      packets are transferred, either from host to device (out) or
      from device to host (in).  Transfers are always initiated by the
      host (polled transfers).  Therefore there can only be one host
      per USB bus.  Each transfer of a packet has a status stage in
      which the recipient of the data can return either ACK
      (acknowledge reception), NAK (retry), STALL (error condition) or
      nothing (garbled data stage, device not available or
      disconnected).  Section 8.5 of the USB 2.0 Specification
      explains the details of packets in more detail.  Four different
      types of transfers can occur on a USB bus: control, bulk,
      interrupt and isochronous.  The types of transfers and their
      characteristics are described below.</p><p>Large transfers between the device on the USB bus and the
      device driver are split up into multiple packets by the host
      controller or the HC driver.</p><p>Device requests (control transfers) to the default endpoints
      are special.  They consist of two or three phases: SETUP, DATA
      (optional) and STATUS. The set-up packet is sent to the device.
      If there is a data phase, the direction of the data packet(s) is
      given in the set-up packet.  The direction in the status phase
      is the opposite of the direction during the data phase, or IN if
      there was no data phase.  The host controller hardware also
      provides registers with the current status of the root ports and
      the changes that have occurred since the last reset of the
      status change register.  Access to these registers is provided
      through a virtualised hub as suggested in the USB specification.
      The virtual hub must comply with the hub device class given in
      chapter 11 of that specification.  It must provide a default
      pipe through which device requests can be sent to it.  It
      returns the standard andhub class specific set of descriptors.
      It should also provide an interrupt pipe that reports changes
      happening at its ports.  There are currently two specifications
      for host controllers available: Universal Host Controller
      Interface (<acronym class="acronym">UHCI</acronym>) from Intel and Open Host
      Controller Interface (<acronym class="acronym">OHCI</acronym>) from Compaq,
      Microsoft, and National Semiconductor.  The
      <acronym class="acronym">UHCI</acronym> specification has been designed to
      reduce hardware complexity by requiring the host controller
      driver to supply a complete schedule of the transfers for each
      frame.  OHCI type controllers are much more independent by
      providing a more abstract interface doing a lot of work
      themselves.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp57282168"></a>13.2.1. UHCI</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp57282808" class="indexterm"></a><p>The UHCI host controller maintains a framelist with 1024
	pointers to per frame data structures.  It understands two
	different data types: transfer descriptors (TD) and queue
	heads (QH).  Each TD represents a packet to be communicated to
	or from a device endpoint.  QHs are a means to groupTDs (and
	QHs) together.</p><p>Each transfer consists of one or more packets.  The UHCI
	driver splits large transfers into multiple packets.  For
	every transfer, apart from isochronous transfers, a QH is
	allocated.  For every type of transfer these QHs are collected
	at a QH for that type.  Isochronous transfers have to be
	executed first because of the fixed latency requirement and
	are directly referred to by the pointer in the framelist.  The
	last isochronous TD refers to the QH for interrupt transfers
	for that frame.  All QHs for interrupt transfers point at the
	QH for control transfers, which in turn points at the QH for
	bulk transfers.  The following diagram gives a graphical
	overview of this:</p><p>This results in the following schedule being run in each
	frame.  After fetching the pointer for the current frame from
	the framelist the controller first executes the TDs for all
	the isochronous packets in that frame.  The last of these TDs
	refers to the QH for the interrupt transfers for thatframe.
	The host controller will then descend from that QH to the QHs
	for the individual interrupt transfers.  After finishing that
	queue, the QH for the interrupt transfers will refer the
	controller to the QH for all control transfers.  It will
	execute all the subqueues scheduled there, followed by all the
	transfers queued at the bulk QH.  To facilitate the handling
	of finished or failed transfers different types of interrupts
	are generated by the hardware at the end of each frame.  In
	the last TD for a transfer the Interrupt-On Completion bit is
	set by the HC driver to flag an interrupt when the transfer
	has completed.  An error interrupt is flagged if a TD reaches
	its maximum error count.  If the short packet detect bit is
	set in a TD and less than the set packet length is transferred
	this interrupt is flagged to notify the controller driver of
	the completed transfer.  It is the host controller driver's
	task to find out which transfer has completed or produced an
	error.  When called the interrupt service routine will locate
	all the finished transfers and call their callbacks.</p><p>Refer to the <acronym class="acronym">UHCI</acronym> Specification for a
	more elaborate description.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp57286008"></a>13.2.2. OHCI</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp57286648" class="indexterm"></a><p>Programming an OHCI host controller is much simpler.  The
	controller assumes that a set of endpoints is available, and
	is aware of scheduling priorities and the ordering of the
	types of transfers in a frame.  The main data structure used
	by the host controller is the endpoint descriptor (ED) to
	which a queue of transfer descriptors (TDs) is attached.  The
	ED contains the maximum packet size allowed for an endpoint
	and the controller hardware does the splitting into packets.
	The pointers to the data buffers are updated after each
	transfer and when the start and end pointer are equal, the TD
	is retired to the done-queue.  The four types of endpoints
	(interrupt, isochronous, control, and bulk) have their own
	queues.  Control and bulk endpoints are queued each at their
	own queue.  Interrupt EDs are queued in a tree, with the level
	in the tree defining the frequency at which they run.</p><p>The schedule being run by the host controller in each
	frame looks as follows.  The controller will first run the
	non-periodic control and bulk queues, up to a time limit set
	by the HC driver.  Then the interrupt transfers for that frame
	number are run, by using the lower five bits of the frame
	number as an index into level 0 of the tree of interrupts EDs.
	At the end of this tree the isochronous EDs are connected and
	these are traversed subsequently.  The isochronous TDs contain
	the frame number of the first frame the transfer should be run
	in.  After all the periodic transfers have been run, the
	control and bulk queues are traversed again.  Periodically the
	interrupt service routine is called to process the done queue
	and call the callbacks for each transfer and reschedule
	interrupt and isochronous endpoints.</p><p>See the <acronym class="acronym">UHCI</acronym> Specification for a more
	elaborate description.  The middle layer provides access to
	the device in a controlled way and maintains resources in use
	by the different drivers and the services layer.  The layer
	takes care of the following aspects:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The device configuration information</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The pipes to communicate with a device</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Probing and attaching and detaching form a

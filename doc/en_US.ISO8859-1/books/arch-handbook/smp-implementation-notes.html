	threads asleep on a wait channel.  Each thread that is not
	asleep on a wait channel carries a sleep queue structure
	around with it.  When a thread blocks on a wait channel, it
	donates its sleep queue structure to that wait channel.  Sleep
	queues associated with a wait channel are stored in a hash
	table.</p><p>The sleep queue hash table holds sleep queues for wait
	channels that have at least one blocked thread.  Each entry in
	the hash table is called a sleepqueue chain.  The chain
	contains a linked list of sleep queues and a spin mutex.  The
	spin mutex protects the list of sleep queues as well as the
	contents of the sleep queue structures on the list.  Only one
	sleep queue is associated with a given wait channel.  If
	multiple threads block on a wait channel than the sleep queues
	associated with all but the first thread are stored on a list
	of free sleep queues in the master sleep queue.  When a thread
	is removed from the sleep queue it is given one of the sleep
	queue structures from the master queue's free list if it is
	not the only thread asleep on the queue.  The last thread is
	given the master sleep queue when it is resumed.  Since
	threads may be removed from the sleep queue in a different
	order than they are added, a thread may depart from a sleep
	queue with a different sleep queue structure than the one it
	arrived with.</p><p>The <code class="function">sleepq_lock</code> function locks the
	spin mutex of the sleep queue chain that maps to a specific
	wait channel.  The <code class="function">sleepq_lookup</code> function
	looks in the hash table for the master sleep queue associated
	with a given wait channel.  If no master sleep queue is found,
	it returns <code class="constant">NULL</code>.  The
	<code class="function">sleepq_release</code> function unlocks the spin
	mutex associated with a given wait channel.</p><p>A thread is added to a sleep queue via the
	<code class="function">sleepq_add</code>.  This function accepts the
	wait channel, a pointer to the mutex that protects the wait
	channel, a wait message description string, and a mask of
	flags.  The sleep queue chain should be locked via
	<code class="function">sleepq_lock</code> before this function is
	called.  If no mutex protects the wait channel (or it is
	protected by Giant), then the mutex pointer argument should be
	<code class="constant">NULL</code>.  The flags argument contains a type
	field that indicates the kind of sleep queue that the thread
	is being added to and a flag to indicate if the sleep is
	interruptible (<code class="constant">SLEEPQ_INTERRUPTIBLE</code>).
	Currently there are only two types of sleep queues:
	traditional sleep queues managed via the
	<code class="function">msleep</code> and <code class="function">wakeup</code>
	functions (<code class="constant">SLEEPQ_MSLEEP</code>) and condition
	variable sleep queues (<code class="constant">SLEEPQ_CONDVAR</code>).
	The sleep queue type and lock pointer argument are used solely
	for internal assertion checking.  Code that calls
	<code class="function">sleepq_add</code> should explicitly unlock any
	interlock protecting the wait channel after the associated
	sleepqueue chain has been locked via
	<code class="function">sleepq_lock</code> and before blocking on the
	sleep queue via one of the waiting functions.</p><p>A timeout for a sleep is set by invoking
	<code class="function">sleepq_set_timeout</code>.  The function accepts
	the wait channel and the timeout time as a relative tick count
	as its arguments.  If a sleep should be interrupted by
	arriving signals, the
	<code class="function">sleepq_catch_signals</code> function should be
	called as well.  This function accepts the wait channel as its
	only parameter.  If there is already a signal pending for this
	thread, then <code class="function">sleepq_catch_signals</code> will
	return a signal number; otherwise, it will return 0.</p><p>Once a thread has been added to a sleep queue, it blocks
	using one of the <code class="function">sleepq_wait</code> functions.
	There are four wait functions depending on whether or not the
	caller wishes to use a timeout or have the sleep aborted by
	caught signals or an interrupt from the userland thread
	scheduler.  The <code class="function">sleepq_wait</code> function
	simply waits until the current thread is explicitly resumed by
	one of the wakeup functions.  The
	<code class="function">sleepq_timedwait</code> function waits until
	either the thread is explicitly resumed or the timeout set by
	an earlier call to <code class="function">sleepq_set_timeout</code>
	expires.  The <code class="function">sleepq_wait_sig</code> function
	waits until either the thread is explicitly resumed or its
	sleep is aborted.  The
	<code class="function">sleepq_timedwait_sig</code> function waits until
	either the thread is explicitly resumed, the timeout set by an
	earlier call to <code class="function">sleepq_set_timeout</code>
	expires, or the thread's sleep is aborted.  All of the wait
	functions accept the wait channel as their first parameter.
	In addition, the <code class="function">sleepq_timedwait_sig</code>
	function accepts a second boolean parameter to indicate if the
	earlier call to <code class="function">sleepq_catch_signals</code>
	found a pending signal.</p><p>If the thread is explicitly resumed or is aborted by a
	signal, then a value of zero is returned by the wait function
	to indicate a successful sleep.  If the thread is resumed by
	either a timeout or an interrupt from the userland thread
	scheduler then an appropriate errno value is returned instead.
	Note that since <code class="function">sleepq_wait</code> can only
	return 0 it does not return anything and the caller should
	assume a successful sleep.  Also, if a thread's sleep times
	out and is aborted simultaneously then
	<code class="function">sleepq_timedwait_sig</code> will return an error
	indicating that a timeout occurred.  If an error value of
	0 is returned and either <code class="function">sleepq_wait_sig</code>
	or <code class="function">sleepq_timedwait_sig</code> was used to
	block, then the function
	<code class="function">sleepq_calc_signal_retval</code> should be
	called to check for any pending signals and calculate an
	appropriate return value if any are found.  The signal number
	returned by the earlier call to
	<code class="function">sleepq_catch_signals</code> should be passed as
	the sole argument to
	<code class="function">sleepq_calc_signal_retval</code>.</p><p>Threads asleep on a wait channel are explicitly resumed by
	the <code class="function">sleepq_broadcast</code> and
	<code class="function">sleepq_signal</code> functions.  Both functions
	accept the wait channel from which to resume threads, a
	priority to raise resumed threads to, and a flags argument to
	indicate which type of sleep queue is being resumed.  The
	priority argument is treated as a minimum priority.  If a
	thread being resumed already has a higher priority
	(numerically lower) than the priority argument then its
	priority is not adjusted.  The flags argument is used for
	internal assertions to ensure that sleep queues are not being
	treated as the wrong type.  For example, the condition
	variable functions should not resume threads on a traditional
	sleep queue.  The <code class="function">sleepq_broadcast</code>
	function resumes all threads that are blocked on the specified
	wait channel while <code class="function">sleepq_signal</code> only
	resumes the highest priority thread blocked on the wait
	channel.  The sleep queue chain should first be locked via the
	<code class="function">sleepq_lock</code> function before calling these
	functions.</p><p>A sleeping thread may have its sleep interrupted by
	calling the <code class="function">sleepq_abort</code> function.  This
	function must be called with <code class="varname">sched_lock</code>
	held and the thread must be queued on a sleep queue.  A thread
	may also be removed from a specific sleep queue via the
	<code class="function">sleepq_remove</code> function.  This function
	accepts both a thread and a wait channel as an argument and
	only awakens the thread if it is on the sleep queue for the
	specified wait channel.  If the thread is not on a sleep queue
	or it is on a sleep queue for a different wait channel, then
	this function does nothing.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp55978360"></a>8.5.2. Turnstiles</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp55983096" class="indexterm"></a><p>- Compare/contrast with sleep queues.</p><p>- Lookup/wait/release.

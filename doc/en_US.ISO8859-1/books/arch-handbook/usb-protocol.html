      undefined by the USB specification.  Information on this can be
      found from various sources.  The most accurate source is the
      developer's section on the USB home pages.  From these pages, a
      growing number of deviceclass specifications are available.
      These specifications specify what a compliant device should look
      like from a driver perspective, basic functionality it needs to
      provide and the protocol that is to be used over the
      communication channels.  The USB specification includes the
      description of the Hub Class.  A class specification for Human
      Interface Devices (HID) has been created to cater for keyboards,
      tablets, bar-code readers, buttons, knobs, switches, etc.  A
      third example is the class specification for mass storage
      devices.  For a full list of device classes see the developers
      section on the USB home pages.</p><p>For many devices the protocol information has not yet been
      published however.  Information on the protocol being used might
      be available from the company making the device.  Some companies
      will require you to sign a Non -Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
      before giving you the specifications.  This in most cases
      precludes making the driver open source.</p><p>Another good source of information is the Linux driver
      sources, as a number of companies have started to provide
      drivers for Linux for their devices.  It is always a good idea
      to contact the authors of those drivers for their source of
      information.</p><p>Example: Human Interface Devices The specification for the
      Human Interface Devices like keyboards, mice, tablets, buttons,
      dials,etc. is referred to in other device class specifications
      and is used in many devices.</p><p>For example audio speakers provide endpoints to the digital
      to analogue converters and possibly an extra pipe for a
      microphone.  They also provide a HID endpoint in a separate
      interface for the buttons and dials on the front of the device.
      The same is true for the monitor control class.  It is
      straightforward to build support for these interfaces through
      the available kernel and userland libraries together with the
      HID class driver or the generic driver.  Another device that
      serves as an example for interfaces within one configuration
      driven by different device drivers is a cheap keyboard with
      built-in legacy mouse port.  To avoid having the cost of
      including the hardware for a USB hub in the device,
      manufacturers combined the mouse data received from the PS/2
      port on the back of the keyboard and the key presses from the
      keyboard into two separate interfaces in the same configuration.
      The mouse and keyboard drivers each attach to the appropriate
      interface and allocate the pipes to the two independent
      endpoints.</p><a id="idp57325816" class="indexterm"></a><p>Example: Firmware download Many devices that have been
      developed are based on a general purpose processor with an
      additional USB core added to it.  Because the development of
      drivers and firmware for USB devices is still very new, many
      devices require the downloading of the firmware after they have
      been connected.</p><p>The procedure followed is straightforward.  The device
      identifies itself through a vendor and product Id.  The first
      driver probes and attaches to it and downloads the firmware into
      it.  After that the device soft resets itself and the driver is
      detached.  After a short pause the device announces its presence
      on the bus.  The device will have changed its
      vendor/product/revision Id to reflect the fact that it has been
      supplied with firmware and as a consequence a second driver will
      probe it and attach to it.</p><p>An example of these types of devices is the ActiveWire I/O
      board, based on the EZ-USB chip.  For this chip a generic
      firmware downloader is available.  The firmware downloaded into
      the ActiveWire board changes the revision Id.  It will then
      perform a soft reset of the USB part of the EZ-USB chip to
      disconnect from the USB bus and again reconnect.</p><p>Example: Mass Storage Devices Support for mass storage
      devices is mainly built around existing protocols.  The Iomega
      USB Zipdrive is based on the SCSI version of their drive.  The
      SCSI commands and status messages are wrapped in blocks and
      transferred over the bulk pipes to and from the device,
      emulating a SCSI controller over the USB wire.  ATAPI and UFI
      commands are supported in a similar fashion.</p><a id="idp57357176" class="indexterm"></a><p>The Mass Storage Specification supports 2 different types of
      wrapping of the command block.The initial attempt was based on
      sending the command and status through the default pipe and
      using bulk transfers for the data to be moved between the host
      and the device.  Based on experience a second approach was
      designed that was based on wrapping the command and status
      blocks and sending them over the bulk out and in endpoint.  The
      specification specifies exactly what has to happen when and what
      has to be done in case an error condition is encountered.  The
      biggest challenge when writing drivers for these devices is to
      fit USB based protocol into the existing support for mass
      storage devices.  CAM provides hooks to do this in a fairly
      straight forward way.  ATAPI is less simple as historically the
      IDE interface has never had many different appearances.</p><p>The support for the USB floppy from Y-E Data is again less
      straightforward as a new command set has been designed.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="usb-devprobe.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="usb.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="newbus.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">13.4. Device Probe and Attach </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 14. Newbus</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

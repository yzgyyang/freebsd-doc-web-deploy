	sysctl's, loader tunables, and system calls.</p><p>In most cases, sysctl's and loader tunables of the same
	name modify the same parameters, and control behavior such as
	enforcement of protections relating to various kernel
	subsystems.  In addition, if MAC debugging support is compiled
	into the kernel, several counters will be maintained tracking
	label allocation.  It is generally advisable that
	per-subsystem enforcement controls not be used to control
	policy behavior in production environments, as they broadly
	impact the operation of all active policies.  Instead,
	per-policy controls should be preferred, as they provide
	greater granularity and greater operational consistency for
	policy modules.</p><p>Loading and unloading of policy modules is performed using
	the system module management system calls and other system
	interfaces, including boot loader variables; policy modules
	will have the opportunity to influence load and unload events,
	including preventing undesired unloading of the policy.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="mac-framework-kernel-arch-synchronization"></a>6.5.3. Policy List Concurrency and Synchronization</h3></div></div></div><p>As the set of active policies may change at run-time, and
	the invocation of entry points is non-atomic, synchronization
	is required to prevent loading or unloading of policies while
	an entry point invocation is in progress, freezing the set of
	active policies for the duration.  This is accomplished by
	means of a framework busy count: whenever an entry point is
	entered, the busy count is incremented; whenever it is exited,
	the busy count is decremented.  While the busy count is
	elevated, policy list changes are not permitted, and threads
	attempting to modify the policy list will sleep until the list
	is not busy.  The busy count is protected by a mutex, and a
	condition variable is used to wake up sleepers waiting on
	policy list modifications.  One side effect of this
	synchronization model is that recursion into the MAC Framework
	from within a policy module is permitted, although not
	generally used.</p><p>Various optimizations are used to reduce the overhead of
	the busy count, including avoiding the full cost of
	incrementing and decrementing if the list is empty or contains
	only static entries (policies that are loaded before the
	system starts, and cannot be unloaded).  A compile-time option
	is also provided which prevents any change in the set of
	loaded policies at run-time, which eliminates the mutex
	locking costs associated with supporting dynamically loaded
	and unloaded policies as synchronization is no longer
	required.</p><p>As the MAC Framework is not permitted to block in some
	entry points, a normal sleep lock cannot be used; as a result,
	it is possible for the load or unload attempt to block for a
	substantial period of time waiting for the framework to become
	idle.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="mac-framework-kernel-arch-label-synchronization"></a>6.5.4. Label Synchronization</h3></div></div></div><p>As kernel objects of interest may generally be accessed
	from more than one thread at a time, and simultaneous entry of
	more than one thread into the MAC Framework is permitted,
	security attribute storage maintained by the MAC Framework is
	carefully synchronized.  In general, existing kernel
	synchronization on kernel object data is used to protect MAC
	Framework security labels on the object: for example, MAC
	labels on sockets are protected using the existing socket
	mutex.  Likewise, semantics for concurrent access are
	generally identical to those of the container objects: for
	credentials, copy-on-write semantics are maintained for label
	contents as with the remainder of the credential structure.
	The MAC Framework asserts necessary locks on objects when
	invoked with an object reference.  Policy authors must be
	aware of these synchronization semantics, as they will
	sometimes limit the types of accesses permitted on labels: for
	example, when a read-only reference to a credential is passed
	to a policy via an entry point, only read operations are
	permitted on the label state attached to the
	credential.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="mac-framework-kernel-arch-policy-synchronization"></a>6.5.5. Policy Synchronization and Concurrency</h3></div></div></div><p>Policy modules must be written to assume that many kernel
	threads may simultaneously enter one more policy entry points
	due to the parallel and preemptive nature of the FreeBSD
	kernel.  If the policy module makes use of mutable state, this
	may require the use of synchronization primitives within the
	policy to prevent inconsistent views on that state resulting
	in incorrect operation of the policy.  Policies will generally
	be able to make use of existing FreeBSD synchronization
	primitives for this purpose, including mutexes, sleep locks,
	condition variables, and counting semaphores.  However,
	policies should be written to employ these primitives
	carefully, respecting existing kernel lock orders, and
	recognizing that some entry points are not permitted to sleep,
	limiting the use of primitives in those entry points to
	mutexes and wakeup operations.</p><p>When policy modules call out to other kernel subsystems,
	they will generally need to release any in-policy locks in
	order to avoid violating the kernel lock order or risking lock
	recursion.  This will maintain policy locks as leaf locks in
	the global lock order, helping to avoid deadlock.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="mac-framework-kernel-arch-registration"></a>6.5.6. Policy Registration</h3></div></div></div><p>The MAC Framework maintains two lists of active policies:
	a static list, and a dynamic list.  The lists differ only with
	regards to their locking semantics: an elevated reference
	count is not required to make use of the static list.  When
	kernel modules containing MAC Framework policies are loaded,
	the policy module will use <code class="literal">SYSINIT</code> to
	invoke a registration function; when a policy module is
	unloaded, <code class="literal">SYSINIT</code> will likewise invoke a
	de-registration function.  Registration may fail if a policy
	module is loaded more than once, if insufficient resources are
	available for the registration (for example, the policy might
	require labeling and insufficient labeling state might be
	available), or other policy prerequisites might not be met
	(some policies may only be loaded prior to boot).  Likewise,
	de-registration may fail if a policy is flagged as not
	unloadable.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="mac-framework-kernel-arch-entrypoints"></a>6.5.7. Entry Points</h3></div></div></div><p>Kernel services interact with the MAC Framework in two
	ways: they invoke a series of APIs to notify the framework of
	relevant events, and they provide a policy-agnostic label
	structure pointer in security-relevant objects.  The label
	pointer is maintained by the MAC Framework via label
	management entry points, and permits the Framework to offer a
	labeling service to policy modules through relatively
	non-invasive changes to the kernel subsystem maintaining the
	object.  For example, label pointers have been added to
	processes, process credentials, sockets, pipes, vnodes, Mbufs,
	network interfaces, IP reassembly queues, and a variety of
	other security-relevant structures.  Kernel services also
	invoke the MAC Framework when they perform important security
	decisions, permitting policy modules to augment those
	decisions based on their own criteria (possibly including data
	stored in security labels).  Most of these security critical
	decisions will be explicit access control checks; however,
	some affect more general decision functions such as packet
	matching for sockets and label transition at program
	execution.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="mac-framework-kernel-arch-composition"></a>6.5.8. Policy Composition</h3></div></div></div><p>When more than one policy module is loaded into the kernel
	at a time, the results of the policy modules will be composed
	by the framework using a composition operator.  This operator
	is currently hard-coded, and requires that all active policies
	must approve a request for it to return success.  As policies
	may return a variety of error conditions (success, access
	denied, object does not exist, ...), a precedence operator
	selects the resulting error from the set of errors returned by
	policies.  In general, errors indicating that an object does
	not exist will be preferred to errors indicating that access
	to an object is denied.  While it is not guaranteed that the
	resulting composition will be useful or secure, we have found
	that it is for many useful selections of policies.  For
	example, traditional trusted systems often ship with two or
	more policies using a similar composition.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="mac-framework-kernel-arch-labels"></a>6.5.9. Labeling Support</h3></div></div></div><p>As many interesting access control extensions rely on
	security labels on objects, the MAC Framework provides a set
	of policy-agnostic label management system calls covering a
	variety of user-exposed objects.  Common label types include
	partition identifiers, sensitivity labels, integrity labels,
	compartments, domains, roles, and types.  By policy agnostic,
	we mean that policy modules are able to completely define the
	semantics of meta-data associated with an object.  Policy
	modules participate in the internalization and externalization
	of string-based labels provides by user applications, and can
	expose multiple label elements to applications if
	desired.</p><p>In-memory labels are stored in slab-allocated <code class="varname">struct label</code>, which consists of
	a fixed-length array of unions, each holding a <code class="literal">void
	  *</code> pointer and a <code class="literal">long</code>.  Policies
	registering for label storage will be assigned a "slot"
	identifier, which may be used to dereference the label
	storage.  The semantics of the storage are left entirely up to
	the policy module: modules are provided with a variety of
	entry points associated with the kernel object life cycle,
	including initialization, association/creation, and
	destruction.  Using these interfaces, it is possible to
	implement reference counting and other storage models.  Direct
	access to the object structure is generally not required by
	policy modules to retrieve a label, as the MAC Framework
	generally passes both a pointer to the object and a direct
	pointer to the object's label into entry points.  The primary
	exception to this rule is the process credential, which must
	be manually dereferenced to access the credential label.  This
	may change in future revisions of the MAC Framework.</p><p>Initialization entry points frequently include a sleeping
	disposition flag indicating whether or not an initialization
	is permitted to sleep; if sleeping is not permitted, a failure
	may be returned to cancel allocation of the label (and hence
	object).  This may occur, for example, in the network stack
	during interrupt handling, where sleeping is not permitted, or
	while the caller holds a mutex.  Due to the performance cost
	of maintaining labels on in-flight network packets (Mbufs),
	policies must specifically declare a requirement that Mbuf
	labels be allocated.  Dynamically loaded policies making use
	of labels must be able to handle the case where their init
	function has not been called on an object, as objects may
	already exist when the policy is loaded.  The MAC Framework
	guarantees that uninitialized label slots will hold a 0 or
	NULL value, which policies may use to detect uninitialized
	values.  However, as allocation of Mbuf labels is conditional,
	policies must also be able to handle a NULL label pointer for
	Mbufs if they have been loaded dynamically.</p><p>In the case of file system labels, special support is
	provided for the persistent storage of security labels in
	extended attributes.  Where available, extended attribute
	transactions are used to permit consistent compound updates of
	security labels on vnodes--currently this support is present
	only in the UFS2 file system.  Policy authors may choose to
	implement multilabel file system object labels using one (or
	more) extended attributes.  For efficiency reasons, the vnode
	label (<code class="literal">v_label</code>) is a cache of any on-disk
	label; policies are able to load values into the cache when
	the vnode is instantiated, and update the cache as needed.  As
	a result, the extended attribute need not be directly accessed
	with every access control check.</p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, if a labeled policy permits dynamic
	  unloading, its state slot cannot be reclaimed, which places
	  a strict (and relatively low) bound on the number of

	most of these calls support the policy-agnostic label
	retrieval and manipulation APIs exposed to user
	applications.</p><p>The label management calls accept a label description
	structure, <code class="varname">struct mac</code>,
	which contains a series of MAC label elements.  Each element
	contains a character string name, and character string value.
	Each policy will be given the chance to claim a particular
	element name, permitting policies to expose multiple
	independent elements if desired.  Policy modules perform the
	internalization and externalization between kernel labels and
	user-provided labels via entry points, permitting a variety of
	semantics.  Label management system calls are generally
	wrapped by user library functions to perform memory allocation
	and error handling, simplifying user applications that must

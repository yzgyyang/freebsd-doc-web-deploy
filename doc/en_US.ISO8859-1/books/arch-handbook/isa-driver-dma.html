          The Direct Memory Access (DMA) is implemented in the ISA bus
          through the DMA controller (actually, two of them but that is
          an irrelevant detail).  To make the early ISA devices simple
          and cheap the logic of the bus control and address
          generation was concentrated in the DMA controller.
          Fortunately, FreeBSD provides a set of functions that mostly
          hide the annoying details of the DMA controller from the
          device drivers.
        </p><p>
          The simplest case is for the fairly intelligent
          devices. Like the bus master devices on PCI they can
          generate the bus cycles and memory addresses all by
          themselves. The only thing they really need from the DMA
          controller is bus arbitration. So for this purpose they
          pretend to be cascaded slave DMA controllers. And the only
          thing needed from the system DMA controller is to enable the
          cascaded mode on a DMA channel by calling the following
          function when attaching the driver:
        </p><p>
          <code class="function">void isa_dmacascade(int channel_number)</code>
        </p><p>
          All the further activity is done by programming the
          device. When detaching the driver no DMA-related functions
          need to be called.
        </p><p>
          For the simpler devices things get more complicated. The
          functions used are:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            <code class="function">int isa_dma_acquire(int chanel_number)</code>
          </p><p>
                Reserve a DMA channel. Returns 0 on success or EBUSY
                if the channel was already reserved by this or a
                different driver. Most of the ISA devices are not able
                to share DMA channels anyway, so normally this
                function is called when attaching a device. This
                reservation was made redundant by the modern interface
                of bus resources but still must be used in addition to
                the latter. If not used then later, other DMA routines
                will panic.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <code class="function">int isa_dma_release(int chanel_number)</code>
          </p><p>
                Release a previously reserved DMA channel. No
                transfers must be in progress when the channel is
                released (in addition the device must not try to
                initiate transfer after the channel is released).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <code class="function">void isa_dmainit(int chan, u_int
            bouncebufsize)</code>
          </p><p>
                Allocate a bounce buffer for use with the specified
                channel. The requested size of the buffer can not exceed
                64KB. This bounce buffer will be automatically used
                later if a transfer buffer happens to be not
                physically contiguous or outside of the memory
                accessible by the ISA bus or crossing the 64KB
                boundary. If the transfers will be always done from
                buffers which conform to these conditions (such as
                those allocated by
                <code class="function">bus_dmamem_alloc()</code> with proper
                limitations) then <code class="function">isa_dmainit()</code>
                does not have to be called. But it is quite convenient
                to transfer arbitrary data using the DMA controller.
                The bounce buffer will automatically care of the
                scatter-gather issues.
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>

                    <span class="emphasis"><em>bouncebufsize</em></span> - size of the
                    bounce buffer in bytes

            <code class="function">void isa_dmastart(int flags, caddr_t addr, u_int
            nbytes, int chan)</code>
          </p><p>
                Prepare to start a DMA transfer. This function must be
                called to set up the DMA controller before actually
                starting transfer on the device. It checks that the
                buffer is contiguous and falls into the ISA memory
                range, if not then the bounce buffer is automatically
                used. If bounce buffer is required but not set up by
                <code class="function">isa_dmainit()</code> or too small for
                the requested transfer size then the system will
                panic. In case of a write request with bounce buffer
                the data will be automatically copied to the bounce
                buffer.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>flags - a bitmask determining the type of operation to

                B_RAW - if set then the DMA controller will remember
                the buffer and after the end of transfer will
                automatically re-initialize itself to repeat transfer
                of the same buffer again (of course, the driver may
                change the data in the buffer before initiating
                another transfer in the device). If not set then the
                parameters will work only for one transfer, and
                <code class="function">isa_dmastart()</code> will have to be
                called again before initiating the next
                transfer. Using B_RAW makes sense only if the bounce
                buffer is not used.

            nbytes - length of the buffer. Must be less or equal to
            64KB. Length of 0 is not allowed: the DMA controller will
            understand it as 64KB while the kernel code will
            understand it as 0 and that would cause unpredictable
            effects. For channels number 4 and higher the length must
            be even because these channels transfer 2 bytes at a
            time. In case of an odd length the last byte will not be
            transferred.

            Synchronize the memory after device reports that transfer
            is done. If that was a read operation with a bounce buffer
            then the data will be copied from the bounce buffer to the
            original buffer. Arguments are the same as for
            <code class="function">isa_dmastart()</code>. Flag B_RAW is
            permitted but it does not affect
            <code class="function">isa_dmadone()</code> in any way.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <code class="function">int isa_dmastatus(int channel_number)</code>
          </p><p>
            Returns the number of bytes left in the current transfer
            to be transferred.  In case the flag B_READ was set in
            <code class="function">isa_dmastart()</code> the number returned
            will never be equal to zero. At the end of transfer it
            will be automatically reset back to the length of
            buffer. The normal use is to check the number of bytes
            left after the device signals that the transfer is
            completed.  If the number of bytes is not 0 then something
            probably went wrong with that transfer.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <code class="function">int isa_dmastop(int channel_number)</code>
          </p><p>
            Aborts the current transfer and returns the number of
            bytes left untransferred.

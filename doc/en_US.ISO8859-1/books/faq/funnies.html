Has anyone done any temperature testing while

	    have never seen a mention of FreeBSD.  It seems to run really
	    hot.</p><p>A.  No, but we have done numerous taste tests on
	    blindfolded volunteers who have also had 250 micrograms of
	    LSD-25 administered beforehand.  35% of the volunteers
	    said that FreeBSD tasted sort of orange, whereas <span class="trademark">Linux</span>®
	    tasted like purple haze.  Neither group mentioned any
	    significant variances in temperature.  We eventually had
	    to throw the results of this survey out entirely anyway
	    when we found that too many volunteers were wandering out
	    of the room during the tests, thus skewing the results.
	    We think most of the volunteers are at Apple now, working
	    on their new <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">scratch and sniff</span>&#8221;</span> GUI.  It is
	    a funny old business we are in!</p><p>Seriously, FreeBSD uses the <acronym class="acronym">HLT</acronym> (halt)
	    instruction when the system is idle thus lowering its
	    energy consumption and therefore the heat it generates.
	    Also if you have <acronym class="acronym">ACPI</acronym> (Advanced
	    Configuration and Power Interface) configured, then FreeBSD
	    can also put the CPU into a low power mode.</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idp52102776"></a><a id="letmeoutofhere"></a><p><strong>16.2.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Who is scratching in my memory banks??</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Q.  Is there anything <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">odd</span>&#8221;</span> that FreeBSD
	    does when compiling the kernel which would cause the
	    memory to make a scratchy sound?  When compiling (and for
	    a brief moment after recognizing the floppy drive upon
	    startup, as well), a strange scratchy sound emanates from
	    what appears to be the memory banks.</p><p>A.  Yes!  You will see frequent references to
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">daemons</span>&#8221;</span> in the BSD documentation, and what
	    most people do not know is that this refers to genuine,
	    non-corporeal entities that now possess your computer.
	    The scratchy sound coming from your memory is actually
	    high-pitched whispering exchanged among the daemons as
	    they best decide how to deal with various system
	    administration tasks.</p><p>If the noise gets to you, a good <code class="command">fdisk
	      /mbr</code> from DOS will get rid of them, but do not
	    be surprised if they react adversely and try to stop you.
	    In fact, if at any point during the exercise you hear the
	    satanic voice of Bill Gates coming from the built-in
	    speaker, take off running and do not ever look back!
	    Freed from the counterbalancing influence of the BSD
	    daemons, the twin demons of DOS and <span class="trademark">Windows</span>® are often
	    able to re-assert total control over your machine to the
	    eternal damnation of your soul.  Now that you know, given
	    a choice you would probably prefer to get used to the

	    is converted to heat which is vented through the heatsink
	    / fan assembly.  This is why CPU cooling is increasingly
	    important; as people get used to faster processors, they
	    become careless with their data and more and more of it
	    ends up in <code class="filename">/dev/null</code>, overheating
	    their CPUs.  If you delete <code class="filename">/dev/null</code>
	    (which effectively disables the CPU data sink) your CPU
	    may run cooler but your system will quickly become
	    constipated with all that excess data and start to behave
	    erratically.  If you have a fast network connection you
	    can cool down your CPU by reading data out of
	    <code class="filename">/dev/random</code> and sending it off
	    somewhere; however you run the risk of overheating your
	    network connection and <code class="filename">/</code> or angering
	    your ISP, as most of the data will end up getting
	    converted to heat by their equipment, but they generally
	    have good cooling, so if you do not overdo it you should
	    be OK.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Paul Robinson adds:</em></span></p><p>There are other methods.  As every good sysadmin
	    knows, it is part of standard practice to send data to the
	    screen of interesting variety to keep all the pixies that
	    make up your picture happy.  Screen pixies (commonly
	    mis-typed or re-named as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pixels</span>&#8221;</span>) are
	    categorized by the type of hat they wear (red, green or
	    blue) and will hide or appear (thereby showing the color
	    of their hat) whenever they receive a little piece of
	    food.  Video cards turn data into pixie-food, and then
	    send them to the pixies &#8212; the more expensive the
	    card, the better the food, so the better behaved the
	    pixies are.  They also need constant stimulation &#8212;
	    this is why screen savers exist.</p><p>To take your suggestions further, you could just throw
	    the random data to console, thereby letting the pixies
	    consume it.  This causes no heat to be produced at all,
	    keeps the pixies happy and gets rid of your data quite
	    quickly, even if it does make things look a bit messy on
	    your screen.</p><p>Incidentally, as an ex-admin of a large ISP who
	    experienced many problems attempting to maintain a stable
	    temperature in a server room, I would strongly discourage
	    people sending the data they do not want out to the
	    network.  The fairies who do the packet switching and
	    routing get annoyed by it as well.</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idp52402680"></a><a id="punk-my-friend"></a><p><strong>16.5.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>My colleague sits at the computer too much, how

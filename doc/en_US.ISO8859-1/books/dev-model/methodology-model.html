                    There is no defined model for how people write code in
                    FreeBSD. However, Niels Jørgenssen has suggested a model of
                    how written code is integrated into the project.
                </p><p>
                    Jørgenssen's model for change integration
                    </p><div class="informaltable"><table class="informaltable" width="100%" border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>Next if successful</th><th>Next if unsuccessful</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>code</td><td>review</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>review</td><td>pre-commit test</td><td>code</td></tr><tr><td>pre-commit test</td><td>development release</td><td>code</td></tr><tr><td>development release</td><td>parallel debugging</td><td>code</td></tr><tr><td>parallel debugging</td><td>production release</td><td>code</td></tr><tr><td>production release</td><td> </td><td>code</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>

                    The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">development release</span>&#8221;</span> is the FreeBSD-CURRENT
                    ("-CURRENT") branch and the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">production release</span>&#8221;</span>
                    is the FreeBSD-STABLE branch ("-STABLE")
                    [<span class="citation"><a class="xref" href="bibliography.html#jorgensen2001">Jørgensen, 2001</a></span>].
                </p><p>
                    This is a model for one change, and shows that after
                    coding, developers seek community review and
                    try integrating it with their own systems. After integrating the change
                    into the development release, called FreeBSD-CURRENT, it is tested
                    by many users and developers in the FreeBSD community. After it
                    has gone through enough testing, it is merged into the production
                    release, called FreeBSD-STABLE. Unless each stage is finished
                    successfully, the developer needs to go back and make
                    modifications in the code and restart the process. To integrate a
                    change with either -CURRENT or -STABLE is called making a commit.
                </p><p>
                    Jørgensen found that most FreeBSD developers work
                    individually, meaning that this model is used in parallel by
                    many developers on the different ongoing development efforts. A
                    developer can also be working on multiple changes, so that while
                    they are waiting for review or people to test one or more of their
                    changes, they may be writing another change.
                </p><p>
                    As each commit represents an increment, this is a massively
                    incremental model. The commits are in fact so frequent that
                    during one year
                    <a href="#ftn.idp47195896" class="footnote" id="idp47195896"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a>
                    , 85427 commits were made, making a daily average of 233
                    commits.
                </p><p>
                    Within the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">code</span>&#8221;</span> bracket in Jørgensen's
                    model, each programmer has their own working style and follows their
                    own development models. The bracket could very well have been
                    called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">development</span>&#8221;</span> as it includes requirements
                    gathering and analysis, system and detailed design,
                    implementation and verification. However, the only
                    output from these stages is the source code or system documentation.
                </p><p>
                    From a stepwise model's perspective (such as the waterfall
                    model), the other brackets can be seen as further verification
                    and system integration. This system integration is also important
                    to see if a change is accepted by the community. Up until the
                    code is committed, the developer is free to choose how much to
                    communicate about it to the rest of the project. In order for
                    -CURRENT to work as a buffer (so that bright ideas that had some
                    undiscovered drawbacks can be backed out) the minimum time a
                    commit should be in -CURRENT before merging it to -STABLE is 3
                    days. Such a merge is referred to as an MFC (Merge From Current).
                </p><p>
                    It is important to notice the word <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">change</span>&#8221;</span>. Most
                    commits do not contain radical new features, but are maintenance
                    updates.
                </p><p>
                    The only exceptions from this model are security fixes and
                    changes to features that are deprecated in the -CURRENT branch.
                    In these cases, changes can be committed directly to the -STABLE branch.
                </p><p>
                    In addition to many people working on the project, there are
                    many related projects to the FreeBSD Project. These are either
                    projects developing brand new features,
                    sub-projects or projects whose outcome is incorporated into
                    FreeBSD
                    <a href="#ftn.idp47205880" class="footnote" id="idp47205880"><sup class="footnote">[4]</sup></a>.
                    These projects fit into the FreeBSD Project just like regular
                    development efforts: they produce code that is integrated with
                    the FreeBSD Project. However, some of them (like Ports and
                    Documentation) have the privilege of being applicable to both
                    branches or commit directly to both -CURRENT and -STABLE.
                </p><p>
                    There is no standards to how design should be done, nor is
                    design collected in a centralised repository.
                    The main design is that of 4.4BSD.
                    <a href="#ftn.idp47210488" class="footnote" id="idp47210488"><sup class="footnote">[5]</sup></a>

                    As design is a part of the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Code</span>&#8221;</span> bracket in
                    Jørgenssen's model, it is up to every developer or
                    sub-project how this should be done.


                    Even if the design should be stored in a central repository,
                    the output from the design stages would be of limited use as
                    the differences of methodologies would make them poorly if at
                    all interoperable. For the overall design of the project, the
                    project relies on the sub-projects to negotiate fit interfaces
                    between each other rather than to dictate interfacing.

                            For instance, the development of the Bluetooth stack started
                            as a sub-project until it was deemed stable enough to be
                            merged into the -CURRENT branch. Now it is a part of the core
                            FreeBSD system.

                            According to Kirk McKusick, after 20 years of developing
                            UNIX operating systems, the interfaces are for the most part
                            figured out. There is therefore no need for much
                            design. However, new applications of the system and new hardware leads to
                            some implementations being more beneficial than those that
                            used to be preferred. One example is the introduction of web
                            browsing that made the normal TCP/IP connection a short
                            burst of data rather than a steady stream over a longer
                            period of time.

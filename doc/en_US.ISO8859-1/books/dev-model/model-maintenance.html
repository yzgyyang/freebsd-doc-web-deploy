                    It is an advantage to the project to for each area of the source
                    have at least one person that knows this area well.

                    Some parts of the code have designated
                    maintainers. Others have de-facto maintainers, and some
                    parts of the system do not have
                    maintainers.

                    The maintainer is usually a person from the sub-project that
                    wrote and integrated the code, or someone who has ported it from
                    the platform it was written for.

                    The maintainer's job is to make sure the code is in sync with the
                    project the code comes from if it is contributed code, and apply patches
                    submitted by the community or write fixes to issues that are
                    discovered.

                    The main bulk of work that is put into the FreeBSD project is
                    maintenance. [<span class="citation"><a class="xref" href="bibliography.html#jorgensen2001">Jørgensen, 2001</a></span>]

                    As of this writing, there were 269 committers in the
                    project. When they commit a change to a branch, that constitutes
                    a new release. It is very common for users in the community to
                    track a particular branch. The immediate existence of a new
                    release makes the changes widely available right away and allows
                    for rapid feedback from the community. This also gives the
                    community the response time they expect on issues that are of
                    importance to them. This makes the community more engaged, and
                    thus allows for more and better feedback that again spurs more
                    maintenance and ultimately should create a better product.

                    Before making changes to code in parts of the tree
                    that has a history unknown to the committer, the
                    committer is required to read the commit logs to see why
                    certain features are implemented the way they are in
                    order not to make mistakes that have previously either been
                    thought through or resolved.

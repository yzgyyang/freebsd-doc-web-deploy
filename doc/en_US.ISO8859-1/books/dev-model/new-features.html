                    Within the project there are sub-projects that are working on
                    new features. These projects are generally done by one person
                    [<span class="citation"><a class="xref" href="bibliography.html#jorgensen2001">Jørgensen, 2001</a></span>].
                    Every project is free to
                    organise development as it sees fit. However, when the project
                    is merged to the -CURRENT branch it must follow the project
                    guidelines. When the code has been well tested in the
                    -CURRENT branch and deemed stable enough and relevant
                    to the -STABLE branch, it is merged to the -STABLE branch.
                </p><p>
                    The requirements of the project are given by developer
                    wishes, requests from the community in terms of direct
                    requests by mail, Problem Reports, commercial funding for the development
                    of features, or contributions by the scientific community.
                    The wishes that come within the responsibility of a developer
                    are given to that developer who prioritises their time between
                    the request and their wishes. A common way to do this is maintain
                    a TODO-list maintained by the project. Items that do not come within
                    someone's responsibility are collected on TODO-lists unless someone
                    volunteers to take the responsibility. All
                    requests, their distribution and follow-up are
                    handled by the <a class="xref" href="tool-bugzilla.html" title="7.2. Bugzilla">Bugzilla</a> tool.
                </p><p>
                    Requirements analysis happens in two ways. The requests that
                    come in are discussed on mailing lists, both within the main
                    project and in the sub-project that the request belongs to or is
                    spawned by the request. Furthermore, individual developers on
                    the sub-project will evaluate the feasibility of the requests
                    and determine the prioritisation between them. Other than archives
                    of the discussions that have taken place, no outcome is created
                    by this phase that is merged into the main project.
                </p><p>
                    As the requests are prioritised by the individual developers on
                    the basis of doing what they find interesting, necessary, or are
                    funded to do, there is no overall strategy or prioritisation of
                    what requests to regard as requirements and following up their
                    correct implementation. However, most developers have some
                    shared vision of what issues are more important, and they can
                    ask for guidelines from the release engineering team.
                    
                </p><p>
                    The verification phase of the project is two-fold. Before
                    committing code to the current-branch, developers request their
                    code to be reviewed by their peers. This review is for the most
                    part done by functional testing, but also code review is
                    important. When the code is committed to the branch, a broader
                    functional testing will happen, that may trigger further code
                    review and debugging should the code not behave as
                    expected. This second verification form may be regarded as
                    structural verification.
                    Although the sub-projects themselves may write formal
                    tests such as unit tests, these are usually not collected by the main
                    project and are usually removed before the code is committed to
                    the current branch.

                            More and more tests are however performed when
                            building the system (<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">make
                            world</span>&#8221;</span>). These tests are however a very new
                            addition and no systematic framework for these
                            tests have yet been created.

                While no-one takes ownership of FreeBSD, the FreeBSD
                organisation is divided into core, committers and contributors
                and is part of the FreeBSD community that lives around it.

            </p><p>
                The FreeBSD Project's structure (in order of descending authority)
                </p><div class="informaltable"><table class="informaltable" width="100%" border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Group</th><th>Number of people</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Core members</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Committers</td><td>269</td></tr><tr><td>Contributors</td><td>~3000</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
            </p><p>
                Number of committers has been determined by going through
                CVS logs from January 1st, 2004 to December 31st, 2004 and
                contributors by going through the list of contributions and
                problem reports.
            </p><p>
                The main resource in the FreeBSD community is its developers: the
                committers and contributors. It is with their contributions that the
                project can move forward. Regular developers are referred to as contributors.
                As of January 1st, 2003, there are an estimated 5500
                contributors on the project.
		

            </p><p>
                Committers are developers with the privilege of being able to
                commit changes. These are usually the
                most active developers who are willing to
                spend their time not only integrating their own code but
                integrating code submitted by the developers who
                do not have this privilege. They are also the developers who elect
                the core team, and they have access to closed discussions.
            </p><p>
	        

                The project can be grouped into four distinct separate parts,
                and most developers will focus their involvement in one
		part of FreeBSD. 

		The four parts
                are kernel development, userland development, ports and
                documentation. When referring to the base system, both
                kernel and userland is meant.
            </p><p>
                This split changes our table to look like this:
            </p><p>
                The FreeBSD Project's structure with committers in categories
                </p><div class="informaltable"><table class="informaltable" width="100%" border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Group</th><th>Category</th><th>Number of people</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Core members</td><td> </td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Committers</td><td>Kernel</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Userland</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Docs</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Ports</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Total</td><td>269</td></tr><tr><td>Contributors</td><td> </td><td>~3000</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
            </p><p>
                Number of committers per area has been determined by going through
                CVS logs from January 1st, 2004 to December 31st, 2004.
                Note that many committers work in multiple
                areas, making the total number higher than the real number
                of committers. The total number of committers at that
                time was 269. 
            </p><p>
                Committers fall into three
                groups: committers who are only concerned with one area of
                the project (for instance file systems), committers who
                are involved only with one sub-project,
                and committers who commit to different parts
                of the code, including sub-projects.
                Because some committers work on different parts, the total
                number in the committers section of the table is higher than
                in the above table.
            </p><p>
                The kernel is the main building block of FreeBSD. While
                the userland applications are protected against faults in
                other userland applications, the entire system is
                vulnerable to errors in the kernel. This, combined with the
                vast amount of dependencies in the kernel and that it is not easy to
                see all the consequences of a kernel change, demands
                developers with a relative full understanding of the
                kernel. Multiple development efforts in the kernel also
                require a closer coordination than userland applications do.
            </p><p>
                The core utilities, known as userland, provide the interface that identifies
                FreeBSD, both user interface, shared libraries and external interfaces to
                connecting clients. Currently, 162 people are involved in userland
                development and maintenance, many being maintainers for
                their own part of the code.
                Maintainership will
                be discussed in the <a class="xref" href="sect-hats.html#role-maintainer" title="5.1.4. Maintainership">Maintainership</a> section.
            </p><p>
                Documentation is handled by <a class="xref" href="sub-project-documentation.html" title="8.2. The FreeBSD Documentation Project">The FreeBSD                 Documentation Project</a>
                and includes all documents surrounding the
                FreeBSD project, including the web pages. There were during 2004 101
		people making commits to the FreeBSD Documentation Project.
            </p><p>
                Ports is the collection of meta-data that is needed to make
                software packages build correctly on FreeBSD. An example of a port
                is the port for the web-browser Mozilla. It contains
                information about where to fetch the source, what patches to
                apply and how, and how the package should be installed on the
                system. This allows automated tools to fetch, build and
                install the package. As of this writing, there are more than
                12600 ports available.
                <a href="#ftn.idp47126136" class="footnote" id="idp47126136"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a>
                , ranging
                from web servers to games, programming languages and most of the
                application types that are in use on modern computers.

                Ports will be discussed further in the section
                <a class="xref" href="sub-projects.html#sub-project-ports" title="8.1. The Ports Subproject">The Ports Subproject</a>.

                    The FreeBSD project has a Release Engineering  team with a
                    principal release engineer that is responsible for creating releases
                    of FreeBSD that can be brought out to the user community via the
                    net or sold in retail outlets. Since FreeBSD is available on multiple
                    platforms and releases for the different architectures are made
                    available at the same time, the team has one person in charge of
                    each architecture. Also, there are roles in the team responsible
                    for coordinating quality assurance  efforts, building a package
                    set and for having an updated set of documents.
                    When referring to the release engineer,
                    a representative for the release engineering team is
                    meant.
                </p><p>
                    When a release is coming, the FreeBSD project changes shape
                    somewhat. A release schedule is made containing feature- and
                    code-freezes, release of interim releases and the final
                    release. A feature-freeze means no new features are allowed to
                    be committed to the branch without the release engineers'
                    explicit consent. Code-freeze means no changes to the code (like
                    bugs-fixes) are allowed to be committed without the release
                    engineers' explicit consent. This feature- and code-freeze is
                    known as stabilising. During the release process, the release
                    engineer has the full authority to revert to older versions of
                    code and thus "back out" changes should they find that the changes
                    are not suitable to be included in the release.
                </p><p>
                    There are three different kinds of releases:
                    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
                                .0 releases are the first release of a major
                                version. These are branched of the -CURRENT branch
                                and have a significantly longer release engineering
                                cycle due to the unstable nature of the -CURRENT branch
                        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                                .X releases are releases of the -STABLE
                                branch. They are scheduled to come out every 4 months.
                        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                                .X.Y releases are security releases that follow
                                the .X branch. These come out only when sufficient
                                security fixes have been merged since the last
                                release on that branch. New features are rarely
                                included, and the security team is far more
                                involved in these than in regular releases.

                        </p></li></ol></div><p>

                </p><p>
                    For releases of the -STABLE-branch, the release process starts 45
                    days before the anticipated
                    release date. During the first phase, the first 15 days, the
                    developers merge what changes they have had in -CURRENT
                    that they want to have in the release to the release
                    branch. When this period is over, the code enters a 15
                    day code freeze in which only bug fixes, documentation updates,
                    security-related fixes and minor device driver changes are
                    allowed. These changes must be approved by the release engineer
                    in advance. At the beginning of the last 15 day period a release
                    candidate is created for widespread testing. Updates are less
                    likely to be allowed during this period, except for important
                    bug fixes and security updates. In this final period, all
                    releases are considered release candidates. At the end of the
                    release process, a release is created with the new version
                    number, including binary distributions on web sites and the
                    creation of CD-ROM images.  However, the release is not
                    considered "really released" until a <a class="xref" href="tool-pgp.html" title="7.4. Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</a>-signed message stating
                    exactly that, is sent to the mailing list freebsd-announce; anything
                    labelled as a "release" before that may well be in-process and
                    subject to change before the PGP-signed message is sent.

                </p><p>
                    The releases of the -CURRENT-branch (that is, all releases that
                    end with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">.0</span>&#8221;</span>) are very similar, but with twice as
                    long timeframe. It starts 8 weeks prior to the release with
                    announcement of the release time line. Two weeks into the
                    release process, the feature freeze is initiated and performance
                    tweaks should be kept to a minimum. Four weeks prior to the
                    release, an official beta version is made available. Two weeks
                    prior to release, the code is officially branched into a new
                    version. This version is given release candidate status, and as
                    with the release engineering of -STABLE, the code freeze of the
                    release candidate is
                    hardened. However, development on the main development branch
                    can continue. Other than these differences, the release
                    engineering processes are alike.

                </p><p>
                    .0 releases go into their own branch and are aimed
                    mainly at early adopters. The branch then goes through a period
                    of stabilisation, and it is not until the <a class="xref" href="official-hats.html#role-releng">Release Engineering Team</a>
                    decides the demands to stability have been satisfied that
                    the branch becomes -STABLE and -CURRENT targets the next major
                    version. While this for the majority has been with .1 versions,
                    this is not a demand.
                </p><p>
                    Most releases are made when a given date that has been deemed a
                    long enough time since the previous release comes. A target is
                    set for having major releases every 18 months and minor
                    releases every 4 months.

                    The user community has made it very clear that security and
                    stability cannot be sacrificed by self-imposed deadlines and
                    target release dates.

                    For slips of time not to become too long with regards to security
                    and stability issues,
                    extra discipline is required when committing changes to -STABLE.

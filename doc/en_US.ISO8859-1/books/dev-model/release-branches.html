                    The releases of FreeBSD are best illustrated by a tree with many
                    branches where each major branch represents a major
                    version. Minor versions are represented by branches of the
                    major branches.
                </p><p>
                    In the following release tree, arrows that follow one-another
                    in a particular direction
                    represent a branch. Boxes with full lines and diamonds represent official
                    releases. Boxes with dotted lines represent the development
                    branch at that time. Security branches are represented by ovals.
                    Diamonds differ from boxes in that they
                    represent a fork, meaning a place where a branch splits into two
                    branches where one of the branches becomes a sub-branch.
                    For example,
                    at 4.0-RELEASE the 4.0-CURRENT branch split into 4-STABLE and
                    5.0-CURRENT. At 4.5-RELEASE, the branch forked off a security
                    branch called RELENG_4_5.

                    The latest -CURRENT version
                    is always referred to as -CURRENT, while the latest -STABLE
                    release is always referred to as -STABLE. In this figure,
                    -STABLE refers to 4-STABLE while -CURRENT refers to
                    5.0-CURRENT following 5.0-RELEASE.
                    [<span class="citation"><a class="xref" href="bibliography.html#freebsd-releng">FreeBSD, 2002E</a></span>]
                </p><p>
                    A <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">major release</span>&#8221;</span> is always made from the -CURRENT branch.
                    However, the -CURRENT branch does not need to fork at that point in time,
                    but can focus on stabilising. An example of this is that following
                    3.0-RELEASE, 3.1-RELEASE was also a continuation of the
                    -CURRENT-branch, and -CURRENT did not become a true development
                    branch until this version was released and the 3-STABLE branch
                    was forked. When
                    -CURRENT returns to becoming a development branch, it can only be
                    followed by a major release. 5-STABLE is predicted to be forked
                    off 5.0-CURRENT at around 5.3-RELEASE. It is not until
                    5-STABLE is forked that the development branch will be branded 6.0-CURRENT.

                    A <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">minor release</span>&#8221;</span> is made from the -CURRENT branch
                    following a major release, or from the -STABLE branch.
                </p><p>
                    Following and including, 4.3-RELEASE<a href="#ftn.idp47290616" class="footnote" id="idp47290616"><sup class="footnote">[6]</sup></a>, when a minor release has been made, it becomes a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">security
                    branch</span>&#8221;</span>. This is meant for organisations that do not want
                    to follow the -STABLE branch and the potential new/changed features it
                    offers, but instead require an absolutely stable environment, only
                    updating to implement security updates.

                    Each update to a security branch
                    is called a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">patchlevel</span>&#8221;</span>. For every security
                    enhancement that is done, the patchlevel number is increased,
                    making it easy for people tracking the branch to see what
                    security enhancements they have implemented. In cases where there
                    have been especially serious security flaws, an entire new release
                    can be made from a security branch. An example of this is
                    4.6.2-RELEASE.

                            The first release this actually happened for was 4.5-RELEASE,
                            but security branches were at the same time created for
                            4.3-RELEASE and 4.4-RELEASE.

                            There is a terminology
                            overlap with respect to the word "stable", which leads to some
                            confusion. The -STABLE branch is still a
                            development branch, whose goal is to be
                            useful for most people.
                            If it is never acceptable for a system to get changes that
                            are not announced at the time it is deployed,
                            that system should run a security branch.

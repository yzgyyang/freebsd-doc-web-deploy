      do various things; sometimes the instruction it has to perform
      depends on what happened when it performed a previous
      instruction.  This section gives an overview of the two main
      ways in which you can give these instructions, or
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">commands</span>&#8221;</span> as they are usually called.  One way
      uses an <em class="firstterm">interpreter</em>, the other a
      <em class="firstterm">compiler</em>.  As human languages are too
      difficult for a computer to understand in an unambiguous way,
      commands are usually written in one or other languages specially
      designed for the purpose.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp47176568"></a>2.3.1. Interpreters</h3></div></div></div><p>With an interpreter, the language comes as an environment,
	where you type in commands at a prompt and the environment
	executes them for you.  For more complicated programs, you can
	type the commands into a file and get the interpreter to load
	the file and execute the commands in it.  If anything goes
	wrong, many interpreters will drop you into a debugger to help
	you track down the problem.</p><p>The advantage of this is that you can see the results of
	your commands immediately, and mistakes can be corrected
	readily.  The biggest disadvantage comes when you want to
	share your programs with someone.  They must have the same
	interpreter, or you must have some way of giving it to them,
	and they need to understand how to use it.  Also users may not
	appreciate being thrown into a debugger if they press the
	wrong key! From a performance point of view, interpreters can
	use up a lot of memory, and generally do not generate code as
	efficiently as compilers.</p><p>In my opinion, interpreted languages are the best way to
	start if you have not done any programming before.  This kind
	of environment is typically found with languages like Lisp,
	Smalltalk, Perl and Basic.  It could also be argued that the
	<span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® shell (<code class="command">sh</code>, <code class="command">csh</code>)
	is itself an interpreter, and many people do in fact write
	shell <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">scripts</span>&#8221;</span> to help with various
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">housekeeping</span>&#8221;</span> tasks on their machine.  Indeed,
	part of the original <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® philosophy was to provide lots of
	small utility programs that could be linked together in shell
	scripts to perform useful tasks.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp47188088"></a>2.3.2. Interpreters Available with FreeBSD</h3></div></div></div><p>Here is a list of interpreters that are available from the

First of all, you write
	your code in a file (or files) using an editor.  You then run
	the compiler and see if it accepts your program.  If it did
	not compile, grit your teeth and go back to the editor; if it
	did compile and gave you a program, you can run it either at a
	shell command prompt or in a debugger to see if it works
	properly.<a href="#ftn.idp47289848" class="footnote" id="idp47289848"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a></p><p>Obviously, this is not quite as direct as using an
	interpreter.  However it allows you to do a lot of things
	which are very difficult or even impossible with an
	interpreter, such as writing code which interacts closely with
	the operating system&#8212;or even writing your own operating
	system! It is also useful if you need to write very efficient
	code, as the compiler can take its time and optimize the code,
	which would not be acceptable in an interpreter.  Moreover,
	distributing a program written for a compiler is usually more
	straightforward than one written for an interpreter&#8212;you
	can just give them a copy of the executable, assuming they
	have the same operating system as you.</p><p>As the edit-compile-run-debug cycle is rather tedious when
	using separate programs, many commercial compiler makers have
	produced Integrated Development Environments
	(<acronym class="acronym">IDE</acronym>s for short).  FreeBSD does not include
	an IDE in the base system, but

      mechanisms and options which may be applied to disk
      devices.  In many cases, disks with mechanical parts,
      such as <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> drives, will be the
      bottleneck driving down the overall system performance.  While
      a solution is to install a drive without mechanical parts,
      such as a solid state drive, mechanical drives are not
      going away anytime in the near future.  When tuning disks,
      it is advisable to utilize the features of the <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=iostat&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">iostat</span>(8)</span></a>

	  are small, using just a single fragment (typically 1 K)
	  in the file system and typically 512 bytes in the
	  buffer cache.  With this variable turned off, the buffer
	  cache will only cache a fixed number of directories, even

	  this <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sysctl</span>(8)</span></a> allows the buffer cache to use the
	  <acronym class="acronym">VM</acronym> page cache to cache the directories,
	  making all the memory available for caching directories.
	  However, the minimum in-core memory used to cache a
	  directory is the physical page size (typically 4 K)
	  rather than 512  bytes.  Keeping this option enabled
	  is recommended if the system is running any services which
	  manipulate large numbers of files.  Such services can
	  include web caches, large mail systems, and news systems.
	  Keeping this option on will generally not reduce
	  performance, even with the wasted memory, but one should
	  experiment to find out.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp57568248"></a>11.10.1.2. <code class="varname">vfs.write_behind</code></h4></div></div></div><a id="idp57569016" class="indexterm"></a><p>The <code class="varname">vfs.write_behind</code> <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sysctl</span>(8)</span></a>

	or even a minute behind updating the physical disk.  If the
	system crashes, unwritten data may be lost.  Secondly, Soft
	Updates delay the freeing of file system blocks.  If the
	root file system is almost full, performing a major update,
	such as <code class="command">make installworld</code>, can cause the
	file system to run out of space and the update to fail.</p><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp57587704"></a>11.10.2.1. More Details About Soft Updates</h4></div></div></div><a id="idp57588344" class="indexterm"></a><p>Meta-data updates are updates to non-content data like
	  inodes or directories.  There are two traditional approaches
	  to writing a file system's meta-data back to disk.</p><p>Historically, the default behavior was to write out
	  meta-data updates synchronously.  If a directory changed,
	  the system waited until the change was actually written to
	  disk.  The file data buffers (file contents) were passed
	  through the buffer cache and backed up to disk later on
	  asynchronously.  The advantage of this implementation is
	  that it operates safely.  If there is a failure during an
	  update, meta-data is always in a consistent state.  A
	  file is either created completely or not at all.  If the
	  data blocks of a file did not find their way out of the
	  buffer cache onto the disk by the time of the crash,
	  <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">fsck</span>(8)</span></a> recognizes this and repairs the file system
	  by setting the file length to <code class="literal">0</code>.
	  Additionally, the implementation is clear and simple.  The
	  disadvantage is that meta-data changes are slow.  For
	  example, <code class="command">rm -r</code> touches all the files in a
	  directory sequentially, but each directory change will be
	  written synchronously to the disk.  This includes updates to
	  the directory itself, to the inode table, and possibly to
	  indirect blocks allocated by the file.  Similar
	  considerations apply for unrolling large hierarchies using
	  <code class="command">tar -x</code>.</p><p>The second approach is to use asynchronous meta-data
	  updates.  This is the default for a <acronym class="acronym">UFS</acronym>
	  file system mounted with <code class="command">mount -o async</code>.
	  Since all meta-data updates are also passed through the
	  buffer cache, they will be intermixed with the updates of
	  the file content data.  The advantage of this
	  implementation is there is no need to wait until each
	  meta-data update has been written to disk, so all operations
	  which cause huge amounts of meta-data updates work much
	  faster than in the synchronous case.  This implementation
	  is still clear and simple, so there is a low risk for bugs
	  creeping into the code.  The disadvantage is that there is
	  no guarantee for a consistent state of the file system.
	  If there is a failure during an operation that updated
	  large amounts of meta-data, like a power failure or someone
	  pressing the reset button, the file system will be left
	  in an unpredictable state.  There is no opportunity to
	  examine the state of the file system when the system comes
	  up again as the data blocks of a file could already have
	  been written to the disk while the updates of the inode
	  table or the associated directory were not.  It is
	  impossible to implement a <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">fsck</span>(8)</span></a> which is able to
	  clean up the resulting chaos because the necessary
	  information is not available on the disk.  If the file
	  system has been damaged beyond repair, the only choice
	  is to reformat it and restore from backup.</p><p>The usual solution for this problem is to implement
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>dirty region logging</em></span>, which is also
	  referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>journaling</em></span>.
	  Meta-data updates are still written synchronously, but only
	  into a small region of the disk.  Later on, they are moved
	  to their proper location.  Because the logging area is a
	  small, contiguous region on the disk, there are no long
	  distances for the disk heads to move, even during heavy
	  operations, so these operations are quicker than synchronous
	  updates.  Additionally, the complexity of the implementation
	  is limited, so the risk of bugs being present is low.  A
	  disadvantage is that all meta-data is written twice, once
	  into the logging region and once to the proper location, so
	  performance <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pessimization</span>&#8221;</span> might result.  On
	  the other hand, in case of a crash, all pending meta-data
	  operations can be either quickly rolled back or completed
	  from the logging area after the system comes up again,
	  resulting in a fast file system startup.</p><p>Kirk McKusick, the developer of Berkeley
	  <acronym class="acronym">FFS</acronym>, solved this problem with Soft
	  Updates.  All pending meta-data updates are kept in memory
	  and written out to disk in a sorted sequence
	  (<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">ordered meta-data updates</span>&#8221;</span>).  This has the
	  effect that, in case of heavy meta-data operations, later
	  updates to an item <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">catch</span>&#8221;</span> the earlier ones
	  which are still in memory and have not already been written
	  to disk.  All operations are generally performed in memory
	  before the update is written to disk and the data blocks are
	  sorted according to their position so that they will not be
	  on the disk ahead of their meta-data.  If the system
	  crashes, an implicit <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">log rewind</span>&#8221;</span> causes all
	  operations which were not written to the disk appear as if
	  they never happened.  A consistent file system state is
	  maintained that appears to be the one of 30 to 60 seconds
	  earlier.  The algorithm used guarantees that all resources
	  in use are marked as such in their blocks and inodes.
	  After a crash, the only resource allocation error that
	  occurs is that resources are marked as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">used</span>&#8221;</span>
	  which are actually <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">free</span>&#8221;</span>.  <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">fsck</span>(8)</span></a>
	  recognizes this situation, and frees the resources that
	  are no longer used.  It is safe to ignore the dirty state
	  of the file system after a crash by forcibly mounting it
	  with <code class="command">mount -f</code>.  In order to free
	  resources that may be unused, <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">fsck</span>(8)</span></a> needs to be run
	  at a later time.  This is the idea behind the
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>background <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">fsck</span>(8)</span></a></em></span>: at system
	  startup time, only a <span class="emphasis"><em>snapshot</em></span> of the
	  file system is recorded and <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">fsck</span>(8)</span></a> is run afterwards.
	  All file systems can then be mounted
	  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">dirty</span>&#8221;</span>, so the system startup proceeds in
	  multi-user mode.  Then, background <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">fsck</span>(8)</span></a> is
	  scheduled for all file systems where this is required, to
	  free resources that may be unused.  File systems that do
	  not use Soft Updates still need the usual foreground
	  <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">fsck</span>(8)</span></a>.</p><p>The advantage is that meta-data operations are nearly
	  as fast as asynchronous updates and are faster than
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>logging</em></span>, which has to write the
	  meta-data twice.  The disadvantages are the complexity of
	  the code, a higher memory consumption, and some
	  idiosyncrasies.  After a crash, the state of the file
	  system appears to be somewhat <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">older</span>&#8221;</span>.  In
	  situations where the standard synchronous approach would

	  Updates because neither the meta-data nor the file contents
	  have been written to disk.  Disk space is not released until
	  the updates have been written to disk, which may take place
	  some time after running <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rm&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">rm</span>(1)</span></a>.  This may cause problems
	  when installing large amounts of data on a file system

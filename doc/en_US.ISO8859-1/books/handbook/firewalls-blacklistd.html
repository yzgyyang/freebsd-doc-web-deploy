      notifications from other daemons about connection attempts
      that failed or were successful.  It is most widely used in
      blocking too many connection attempts on open ports.  A
      prime example is <span class="application">SSH</span> running on
      the internet getting a lot of requests from bots or scripts
      trying to guess passwords and gain access.  Using
      <span class="application">blacklistd</span>, the daemon can notify
      the firewall to create a filter rule to block excessive
      connection attempts from a single source after a number of
      tries.  Blacklistd was first developed on
      NetBSD and appeared there in version 7.  FreeBSD 11
      imported blacklistd from NetBSD.</p><p>This chapter describes how to set up blacklistd,
      configure it, and provides examples on how to use it.
      Readers should be familiar with basic firewall concepts like
      rules.  For details, refer to the firewall chapter.  PF is
      used in the examples, but other firewalls available on
      FreeBSD should be able to work with blacklistd, too.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp72711288"></a>30.6.1. Enabling Blacklistd</h3></div></div></div><p>The main configuration for blacklistd is stored in
	<a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=blacklistd.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">blacklistd.conf</span>(5)</span></a>.  Various command line options are
	also available to change blacklistd's run-time behavior.
	Persistent configuration across reboots should be stored
	in <code class="filename">/etc/blacklistd.conf</code>.  To enable
	the daemon during system boot, add a
	<code class="literal">blacklistd_enable</code> line to
	<code class="filename">/etc/rc.conf</code> like this:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>sysrc blacklistd_enable=yes</code></strong></pre><p>To start the service manually, run this command:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>service blacklistd start</code></strong></pre></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp72720632"></a>30.6.2. Creating a Blacklistd Ruleset</h3></div></div></div><p>Rules for blacklistd are configured in

	rule contains a tuple separated by spaces or tabs.  Rules
	either belong to a <code class="literal">local</code> or a
	<code class="literal">remote</code>, which applies to the machine
	where blacklistd is running or an outside source,
	respectively.</p><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp72723192"></a>30.6.2.1. Local Rules</h4></div></div></div><p>An example blacklistd.conf entry for a local rule
	  looks like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">[local]
ssh             stream  *       *               *       3       24h</pre><p>All rules that follow the <code class="literal">[local]</code>
	  section are treated as local rules (which is the
	  default), applying to the local machine.  When a
	  <code class="literal">[remote]</code> section is encountered, all
	  rules that follow it are handled as remote machine
	  rules.</p><p>Seven fields define a rule separated by either tabs
	  or spaces.  The first four fields identify the traffic
	  that should be blacklisted.  The three fields that
	  follow define backlistd's behavior.  Wildcards are
	  denoted as asterisks (<code class="literal">*</code>), matching
	  anything in this field.  The first field defines the
	  location.  In local rules, these are the network ports.
	  The syntax for the location field is as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">[<em class="replaceable"><code>address</code></em>|<em class="replaceable"><code>interface</code></em>][/<em class="replaceable"><code>mask</code></em>][:<em class="replaceable"><code>port</code></em>]</pre><p>Adressses can be specified as IPv4 in numeric format
	    or IPv6 in square brackets.  An interface name like
	    <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>em0</code></em></code> can also
	    be used.</p><p>The socket type is defined by the second field.  TCP
	    sockets are of type <code class="literal">stream</code>, whereas UDP
	    is denoted as <code class="literal">dgram</code>.  The example above
	    uses TCP, since SSH is using that protocol.</p><p>A protocol can be used in the third field of a
	    blacklistd rule.  The following protocols can be used:
	    <code class="literal">tcp</code>, <code class="literal">udp</code>,
	    <code class="literal">tcp6</code>, <code class="literal">udp6</code>, or
	    numeric.  A wildcard, like in the example, is typically
	    used to match all protocols unless there is a reason to
	    distinguish traffic by a certain protocol.</p><p>In the fourth field, the effective user or owner of
	    the daemon process that is reporting the event is defined.
	    The username or <acronym class="acronym">UID</acronym> can be used here,
	    as well as a wildcard (see example rule above).</p><p>The packet filter rule name is declared by the fifth
	    field, which starts the behavior part of the rule.  By
	    default, blacklistd puts all blocks under a pf anchor
	    called <code class="literal">blacklistd</code> in
	    <code class="filename">pf.conf</code> like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">anchor "blacklistd/*" in on $ext_if
block in
pass out</pre><p>For separate blacklists, an anchor name can be used in
	    this field.  In other cases, the wildcard will suffice.
	    When a name starts with a hyphen (<code class="literal">-</code>) it
	    means that an anchor with the default rule name prepended
	    should be used.  A modified example from the above using
	    the hyphen would look like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">ssh             stream  *       *               -ssh       3       24h</pre><p>With such a rule, any new blacklist rules are added to
	    an anchor called <code class="literal">blacklistd-ssh</code>.</p><p>To block whole subnets for a single rule violation, a
	    <code class="literal">/</code> in the rule name can be used.  This
	    causes the remaining portion of the name to be interpreted
	    as the mask to be applied to the address specified in
	    the rule.  For example, this rule would block every
	    address adjoining <code class="literal">/24</code>.</p><pre class="programlisting">22              stream  tcp       *               */24    3       24h</pre><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to specify the proper
	      protocol here.  IPv4 and IPv6 treat /24 differently,
	      that is the reason why <code class="literal">*</code> cannot be
	      used in the third field for this rule.</p></div><p>This rule defines that if any one host in that network
	    is misbehaving, everything else on that network will be
	    blocked, too.</p><p>The sixth field, called <code class="literal">nfail</code>, sets
	    the number of login failures required to blacklist the
	    remote IP in question.  When a wildcard is used at this
	    position, it means that blocks will never happen.  In the
	    example rule above, a limit of three is defined meaning
	    that after three attempts to log into
	    <span class="application">SSH</span> on one connection, the IP
	    is blocked.</p><p>The last field in a blacklistd rule definition
	    specifies how long a host is blacklisted.  The default
	    unit is seconds, but suffixes like <code class="literal">m</code>,
	    <code class="literal">h</code>, and <code class="literal">d</code> can also be
	    specified for minutes, hours, and days,
	    respectively.</p><p>The example rule in its entirety means that after
	    three times authenticating to
	    <span class="application">SSH</span> will result in a new PF
	    block rule for that host.  Rule matches are performed by
	    first checking local rules one after another, from most
	    specific to least specific.  When a match occurs, the
	    <code class="literal">remote</code> rules are applied and the name,
	    <code class="literal">nfail</code>, and disable fields are changed
	    by the <code class="literal">remote</code> rule that matched.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp72756984"></a>30.6.2.2. Remote Rules</h4></div></div></div><p>Remote rules are used to specify how blacklistd
	    changes its behavior depending on the remote host
	    currently being evaluated.  Each field in a remote rule
	    is the same as in a local rule.  The only difference is
	    in the way blacklistd is using them.  To explain it,
	    this example rule is used:</p><pre class="programlisting">[remote]
203.0.113.128/25 *      *       *               =/25    =       48h</pre><p>The address field can be an IP address (either v4 or
	    v6), a port or both.  This allows setting special rules
	    for a specific remote address range like in this example.
	    The fields for type, protocol and owner are identically
	    interpreted as in the local rule.</p><p>The name fields is different though: the equal sign
	    (<code class="literal">=</code>) in a remote rule tells blacklistd
	    to use the value from the matching local rule.  It means
	    that the firewall rule entry is taken and the
	    <code class="systemitem">/25</code> prefix (a
	    netmask of <code class="systemitem">255.255.255.128</code>) is added.
	    When a connection from that address range is blacklisted,
	    the entire subnet is affected.  A PF anchor name can also
	    be used here, in which case blacklistd will add rules for
	    this address block to the anchor of that name.  The
	    default table is used when a wildcard is specified.</p><p>A custom number of failures in the
	    <code class="literal">nfail</code> column can be defined for an
	    address.  This is useful for exceptions to a specific
	    rule, to maybe allow someone a less strict application
	    of rules or a bit more leniency in login tries.
	    Blocking is disabled when an asterisk is used in this
	    sixth field.</p><p>Remote rules allow a stricter enforcement of limits
	    on attempts to log in compared to attempts coming from a
	    local network like an office.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp72761976"></a>30.6.3. Blacklistd Client Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>There are a few software packages in FreeBSD that can

	  Unfortunately, there is no functionality in blacklistd to
	  do that.  However, it is possible to remove the address
	  from the PF table using pfctl.  For each blocked port,
	  there is a child anchor inside the blacklistd anchor
	  defined in <code class="filename">/etc/pf.conf</code>.  For
	  example, if there is a child anchor for blocking port 22
	  it is called <code class="literal">blacklistd/22</code>.  There is a
	  table inside that child anchor that contains the blocked
	  addresses.  This table is called port followed by the port
	  number.  In this example, it would be called
	  <code class="literal">port22</code>.  With that information at hand,
	  it is now possible to use <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pfctl&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pfctl</span>(8)</span></a> to display all
	  addresses listed like this:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>pfctl -a <em class="replaceable"><code>blacklistd/22</code></em> -t <em class="replaceable"><code>port22</code></em> -T show</code></strong>
...
213.0.123.128/25
...</pre><p>After identifying the address to be unblocked from the
	  list, the following command removes it from the list:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>pfctl -a <em class="replaceable"><code>blacklistd/22</code></em> -t <em class="replaceable"><code>port22</code></em> -T delete <em class="replaceable"><code>213.0.123.128/25</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>The address is now removed from PF, but will still
	  show up in the blacklistctl list, since it does not know
	  about any changes made in PF.  The entry in blacklistd's
	  database will eventually expire and be removed from its
	  output eventually.  The entry will be added again if the
	  host is matching one of the block rules in blacklistd
	  again.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="firewalls-ipf.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="firewalls.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="advanced-networking.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">30.5. IPFILTER (IPF) </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 31. Advanced Networking</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

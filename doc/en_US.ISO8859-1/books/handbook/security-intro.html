A weak entry point
      in any system could allow intruders to gain access to critical
      information and cause havoc on an entire network.  One of the
      core principles of information security is the
      <acronym class="acronym">CIA</acronym> triad, which stands for the
      Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of information
      systems.</p><p>The <acronym class="acronym">CIA</acronym> triad is a bedrock concept of
      computer security as customers and users expect their data to be
      protected.  For example, a customer expects that their credit
      card information is securely stored (confidentiality), that
      their orders are not changed behind the scenes (integrity), and
      that they have access to their order information at all times
      (availablility).</p><p>To provide <acronym class="acronym">CIA</acronym>, security professionals
      apply a defense in depth strategy.  The idea of defense in depth
      is to add several layers of security to prevent one single layer
      failing and the entire security system collapsing.  For example,
      a system administrator cannot simply turn on a firewall and
      consider the network or system secure.  One must also audit
      accounts, check the integrity of binaries, and ensure malicious
      tools are not installed.  To implement an effective security
      strategy, one must understand threats and how to defend against
      them.</p><p>What is a threat as it pertains to computer security?
      Threats are not limited to remote attackers who attempt to
      access a system without permission from a remote location.
      Threats also include employees, malicious software, unauthorized
      network devices, natural disasters, security vulnerabilities,
      and even competing corporations.</p><p>Systems and networks can be accessed without permission,
      sometimes by accident, or by remote attackers, and in some
      cases, via corporate espionage or former employees.  As a user,
      it is important to prepare for and admit when a mistake has led
      to a security breach and report possible issues to the security
      team.  As an administrator, it is important to know of the
      threats and be prepared to mitigate them.</p><p>When applying security to systems, it is recommended to
      start by securing the basic accounts and system configuration,
      and then to secure the network layer so that it adheres to the
      system policy and the organization's security procedures.  Many
      organizations already have a security policy that covers the
      configuration of technology devices.  The policy should include
      the security configuration of workstations, desktops, mobile
      devices, phones, production servers, and development servers.
      In many cases, standard operating procedures
      (<acronym class="acronym">SOP</acronym>s) already exist.  When in doubt, ask the
      security team.</p><p>The rest of this introduction describes how some of these
      basic security configurations are performed on a FreeBSD system.
      The rest of this chapter describes some specific tools which can
      be used when implementing a security policy on a FreeBSD
      system.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="security-accounts"></a>13.2.1. Preventing Logins</h3></div></div></div><p>In securing a system, a good starting point is an audit of
	accounts.  Ensure that <code class="systemitem">root</code> has a strong password and
	that this password is not shared.  Disable any accounts that
	do not need login access.</p><p>To deny login access to accounts, two methods exist.  The
	first is to lock the account.  This example locks the
	<code class="systemitem">toor</code> account:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>pw lock <em class="replaceable"><code>toor</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>The second method is to prevent login access by changing
	the shell to <code class="filename">/usr/sbin/nologin</code>.  Only the
	superuser can change the shell for other users:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>chsh -s /usr/sbin/nologin <em class="replaceable"><code>toor</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>The <code class="filename">/usr/sbin/nologin</code> shell prevents
	the system from assigning a shell to the user when they
	attempt to login.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="security-accountmgmt"></a>13.2.2. Permitted Account Escalation</h3></div></div></div><p>In some cases, system administration needs to be shared
	with other users.  FreeBSD has two methods to handle this.  The
	first one, which is not recommended, is a shared root password
	used by members of the <code class="systemitem">wheel</code> group.  With this
	method, a user types <code class="command">su</code> and enters the
	password for <code class="systemitem">wheel</code>
	whenever superuser access is needed.  The user should then
	type <code class="command">exit</code> to leave privileged access after
	finishing the commands that required administrative access.
	To add a user to this group, edit
	<code class="filename">/etc/group</code> and add the user to the end of
	the <code class="literal">wheel</code> entry.  The user must be
	separated by a comma character with no space.</p><p>The second, and recommended, method to permit privilege
	escalation is to install the <a xmlns="" class="package" href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/security/sudo/pkg-descr">security/sudo</a>
	package or port.  This software provides additional auditing,
	more fine-grained user control, and can be configured to lock
	users into running only the specified privileged
	commands.</p><p>After installation, use <code class="command">visudo</code> to edit
	<code class="filename">/usr/local/etc/sudoers</code>.  This example
	creates a new <code class="systemitem">webadmin</code> group, adds the
	<code class="systemitem">trhodes</code> account to
	that group, and configures that group access to restart
	<a xmlns="" class="package" href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/apache24/pkg-descr">apache24</a>:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>pw groupadd webadmin -M trhodes -g 6000</code></strong>

When they
	must be used, they should be complex and a powerful hash
	mechanism should be used to encrypt the version that is stored
	in the password database.  FreeBSD supports the
	<acronym class="acronym">DES</acronym>, <acronym class="acronym">MD5</acronym>,
	<acronym class="acronym">SHA256</acronym>, <acronym class="acronym">SHA512</acronym>, and
	Blowfish hash algorithms in its <code class="function">crypt()</code>
	library.  The default of <acronym class="acronym">SHA512</acronym> should not
	be changed to a less secure hashing algorithm, but can be
	changed to the more secure Blowfish algorithm.</p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blowfish is not part of <acronym class="acronym">AES</acronym> and is
	  not considered compliant with any Federal Information
	  Processing Standards (<acronym class="acronym">FIPS</acronym>).  Its use may
	  not be permitted in some environments.</p></div><p>To determine which hash algorithm is used to encrypt a
	user's password, the superuser can view the hash for the user
	in the FreeBSD password database.  Each hash starts with a symbol
	which indicates the type of hash mechanism used to encrypt the
	password.  If <acronym class="acronym">DES</acronym> is used, there is no
	beginning symbol.  For <acronym class="acronym">MD5</acronym>, the symbol is
	<code class="literal">$</code>.  For <acronym class="acronym">SHA256</acronym> and
	<acronym class="acronym">SHA512</acronym>, the symbol is
	<code class="literal">$6$</code>.  For Blowfish, the symbol is
	<code class="literal">$2a$</code>.  In this example, the password for
	<code class="systemitem">dru</code> is hashed using
	the default <acronym class="acronym">SHA512</acronym> algorithm as the hash
	starts with <code class="literal">$6$</code>.  Note that the encrypted
	hash, not the password itself, is stored in the password
	database:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>grep dru /etc/master.passwd</code></strong>
dru:$6$pzIjSvCAn.PBYQBA$PXpSeWPx3g5kscj3IMiM7tUEUSPmGexxta.8Lt9TGSi2lNQqYGKszsBPuGME0:1001:1001::0:0:dru:/usr/home/dru:/bin/csh</pre><p>The hash mechanism is set in the user's login class.  For
	this example, the user is in the <code class="literal">default</code>
	login class and the hash algorithm is set with this line in
	<code class="filename">/etc/login.conf</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">        :passwd_format=sha512:\</pre><p>To change the algorithm to Blowfish, modify that line to
	look like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">        :passwd_format=blf:\</pre><p>Then run <code class="command">cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf</code> as
	described in <a class="xref" href="security-resourcelimits.html#users-limiting" title="13.13.1. Configuring Login Classes">Section 13.13.1, &#8220;Configuring Login Classes&#8221;</a>.  Note that this
	change will not affect any existing password hashes.  This
	means that all passwords should be re-hashed by asking users
	to run <code class="command">passwd</code> in order to change their
	password.</p><p>For remote logins, two-factor authentication should be
	used.  An example of two-factor authentication is
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">something you have</span>&#8221;</span>, such as a key, and
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">something you know</span>&#8221;</span>, such as the passphrase for
	that key.  Since <span class="application">OpenSSH</span> is part of
	the FreeBSD base system, all network logins should be over an
	encrypted connection and use key-based authentication instead
	of passwords.  For more information, refer to <a class="xref" href="openssh.html" title="13.8. OpenSSH">Section 13.8, &#8220;OpenSSH&#8221;</a>.  Kerberos users may need to make
	additional changes to implement
	<span class="application">OpenSSH</span> in their network.  These
	changes are described in <a class="xref" href="kerberos5.html" title="13.5. Kerberos">Section 13.5, &#8220;<span class="application">Kerberos</span>&#8221;</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="security-pwpolicy"></a>13.2.4. Password Policy Enforcement</h3></div></div></div><p>Enforcing a strong password policy for local accounts is a
	fundamental aspect of system security.  In FreeBSD, password
	length, password strength, and password complexity can be
	implemented using built-in Pluggable Authentication Modules
	(<acronym class="acronym">PAM</acronym>).</p><p>This section demonstrates how to configure the minimum and
	maximum password length and the enforcement of mixed
	characters using the <code class="filename">pam_passwdqc.so</code>
	module.  This module is enforced when a user changes their
	password.</p><p>To configure this module, become the superuser and
	uncomment the line containing
	<code class="literal">pam_passwdqc.so</code> in
	<code class="filename">/etc/pam.d/passwd</code>.  Then, edit that line
	to match the password policy:</p><pre class="programlisting">password        requisite       pam_passwdqc.so         <em class="replaceable"><code>min=disabled,disabled,disabled,12,10 similar=deny retry=3</code></em> enforce=users</pre><p>This example sets several requirements for new passwords.
	The <code class="literal">min</code> setting controls the minimum
	password length.  It has five values because this module
	defines five different types of passwords based on their
	complexity.  Complexity is defined by the type of characters
	that must exist in a password, such as letters, numbers,
	symbols, and case.  The types of passwords are described in
	<a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pam_passwdqc&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pam_passwdqc</span>(8)</span></a>.  In this example, the first three types
	of passwords are disabled, meaning that passwords that meet
	those complexity requirements will not be accepted, regardless
	of their length.    The <code class="literal">12</code> sets a minimum
	password policy of at least twelve characters, if the password
	also contains characters with three types of complexity.  The
	<code class="literal">10</code> sets the password policy to also allow
	passwords of at least ten characters, if the password contains
	characters with four types of complexity.</p><p>The <code class="literal">similar</code> setting denies passwords
	that are similar to the user's previous password.  The
	<code class="literal">retry</code> setting provides a user with three
	opportunities to enter a new password.</p><p>Once this file is saved, a user changing their password
	will see a message similar to the following:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>passwd</code></strong>
Changing local password for trhodes
Old Password:

You can now choose the new password.
A valid password should be a mix of upper and lower case letters,
digits and other characters.  You can use a 12 character long
password with characters from at least 3 of these 4 classes, or
a 10 character long password containing characters from all the
classes.  Characters that form a common pattern are discarded by
the check.
Alternatively, if no one else can see your terminal now, you can
pick this as your password: "trait-useful&amp;knob".
Enter new password:</pre><p>If a password that does not match the policy is entered,
	it will be rejected with a warning and the user will have an
	opportunity to try again, up to the configured number of
	retries.</p><p>Most password policies require passwords to expire after
	so many days.  To set a password age time in FreeBSD, set
	<code class="option">passwordtime</code> for the user's login class in
	<code class="filename">/etc/login.conf</code>.  The
	<code class="literal">default</code> login class contains an
	example:</p><pre class="programlisting">#       :passwordtime=90d:\</pre><p>So, to set an expiry of 90 days for this login class,
	remove the comment symbol (<code class="literal">#</code>), save the
	edit, and run <code class="command">cap_mkdb
	  /etc/login.conf</code>.</p><p>To set the expiration on individual users, pass an
	expiration date or the number of days to expiry and a username
	to <code class="command">pw</code>:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>pw usermod -p <em class="replaceable"><code>30-apr-2015</code></em> -n <em class="replaceable"><code>trhodes</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>As seen here, an expiration date is set in the form of
	day, month, and year.  For more information, see
	<a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pw&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pw</span>(8)</span></a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="security-rkhunter"></a>13.2.5. Detecting Rootkits</h3></div></div></div><p>A <em class="firstterm">rootkit</em> is any unauthorized
	software that attempts to gain <code class="systemitem">root</code> access to a system.  Once
	installed, this malicious software will normally open up
	another avenue of entry for an attacker.  Realistically, once
	a system has been compromised by a rootkit and an
	investigation has been performed, the system should be
	reinstalled from scratch.  There is tremendous risk that even
	the most prudent security or systems engineer will miss
	something an attacker left behind.</p><p>A rootkit does do one thing useful for administrators:
	once detected, it is a sign that a compromise happened at some
	point.  But, these types of applications tend to be very well
	hidden.  This section demonstrates a tool that can be used to
	detect rootkits, <a xmlns="" class="package" href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/security/rkhunter/pkg-descr">security/rkhunter</a>.</p><p>After installation of this package or port, the system may
	be checked using the following command.  It will produce a lot
	of information and will require some manual pressing of
	<span class="keycap"><strong>ENTER</strong></span>:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">#</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>rkhunter -c</code></strong></pre><p>After the process completes, a status message will be
	printed to the screen.  This message will include the amount
	of files checked, suspect files, possible rootkits, and more.
	During the check, some generic security warnings may
	be produced about hidden files, the
	<span class="application">OpenSSH</span> protocol selection, and
	known vulnerable versions of installed software.  These can be
	handled now or after a more detailed analysis has been
	performed.</p><p>Every administrator should know what is running on the
	systems they are responsible for.  Third-party tools like
	<span class="application">rkhunter</span> and
	<a xmlns="" class="package" href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/sysutils/lsof/pkg-descr">sysutils/lsof</a>, and native commands such
	as <code class="command">netstat</code> and <code class="command">ps</code>, can
	show a great deal of information on the system.  Take notes on
	what is normal, ask questions when something seems out of
	place, and be paranoid.  While preventing a compromise is
	ideal, detecting a compromise is a must.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="security-ids"></a>13.2.6. Binary Verification</h3></div></div></div><p>Verification of system files and binaries is important
	because it provides the system administration and security
	teams information about system changes.  A software
	application that monitors the system for changes is called an
	Intrusion Detection System (<acronym class="acronym">IDS</acronym>).</p><p>FreeBSD provides native support for a basic
	<acronym class="acronym">IDS</acronym> system.  While the nightly security
	emails will notify an administrator of changes, the
	information is stored locally and there is a chance that a
	malicious user could modify this information in order to hide
	their changes to the system.  As such, it is recommended to
	create a separate set of binary signatures and store them on a
	read-only, root-owned directory or, preferably, on a removable
	<acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> disk or remote
	<span class="application">rsync</span> server.</p><p>The built-in <code class="command">mtree</code> utility can be used
	to generate a specification of the contents of a directory.  A
	seed, or a numeric constant, is used to generate the
	specification and is required to check that the specification
	has not changed.  This makes it possible to determine if a
	file or binary has been modified.  Since the seed value is
	unknown by an attacker, faking or checking the checksum values
	of files will be difficult to impossible.  The following
	example generates a set of <acronym class="acronym">SHA256</acronym> hashes,
	one for each system binary in <code class="filename">/bin</code>, and
	saves those values to a hidden file in <code class="systemitem">root</code>'s home directory,

	well as any directories containing sensitive data.  Typically,
	specifications are created for <code class="filename">/bin</code>,
	<code class="filename">/sbin</code>, <code class="filename">/usr/bin</code>,
	<code class="filename">/usr/sbin</code>,
	<code class="filename">/usr/local/bin</code>,

	<code class="command">sysctl</code>.  A few of the security features
	which can be tuned to prevent Denial of Service
	(<acronym class="acronym">DoS</acronym>) attacks will be covered in this
	section.  More information about using

	  <code class="command">sysctl</code>, the chance to cause undesired
	  harm is increased, affecting the availability of the system.
	  All changes should be monitored and, if possible, tried on a
	  testing system before being used on a production
	  system.</p></div><p>By default, the FreeBSD kernel boots with a security level of
	<code class="literal">-1</code>.  This is called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">insecure
	  mode</span>&#8221;</span> because immutable file flags may be turned off
	and all devices may be read from or written to.  The security
	level will remain at <code class="literal">-1</code> unless it is
	altered through <code class="command">sysctl</code> or by a setting in
	the startup scripts.  The security level may be increased
	during system startup by setting
	<code class="varname">kern_securelevel_enable</code> to
	<code class="literal">YES</code> in <code class="filename">/etc/rc.conf</code>,
	and the value of <code class="varname">kern_securelevel</code> to the

	<code class="varname">net.inet.udp.blackhole</code> settings can be used
	to drop incoming <acronym class="acronym">SYN</acronym> packets on closed
	ports without sending a return <acronym class="acronym">RST</acronym>
	response.  The default behavior is to return an
	<acronym class="acronym">RST</acronym> to show a port is closed.  Changing the
	default provides some level of protection against ports scans,
	which are used to determine which applications are running on
	a system.  Set <code class="varname">net.inet.tcp.blackhole</code> to
	<code class="literal">2</code> and
	<code class="varname">net.inet.udp.blackhole</code> to

	<code class="varname">net.inet.ip.redirect</code> settings help prevent
	against <em class="firstterm">redirect attacks</em>.  A redirect
	attack is a type of <acronym class="acronym">DoS</acronym> which sends mass
	numbers of <acronym class="acronym">ICMP</acronym> type 5 packets.  Since
	these packets are not required, set
	<code class="varname">net.inet.icmp.drop_redirect</code> to
	<code class="literal">1</code> and set
	<code class="varname">net.inet.ip.redirect</code> to
	<code class="literal">0</code>.</p><p>Source routing is a method for detecting and accessing
	non-routable addresses on the internal network.  This should
	be disabled as non-routable addresses are normally not
	routable on purpose.  To disable this feature, set
	<code class="varname">net.inet.ip.sourceroute</code> and
	<code class="varname">net.inet.ip.accept_sourceroute</code> to
	<code class="literal">0</code>.</p><p>When a machine on the network needs to send messages to
	all hosts on a subnet, an <acronym class="acronym">ICMP</acronym> echo request
	message is sent to the broadcast address.  However, there is
	no reason for an external host to perform such an action.  To
	reject all external broadcast requests, set
	<code class="varname">net.inet.icmp.bmcastecho</code> to
	<code class="literal">0</code>.</p><p>Some additional settings are documented in

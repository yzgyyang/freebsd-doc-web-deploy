      have been developed to make life easier for the administrator.
      These tools often enhance the way systems are installed,
      configured, and maintained.  One of the tools which can be used
      to enhance the security of a FreeBSD system is
      <em class="firstterm">jails</em>.  Jails have been available since
      FreeBSD 4.X and continue to be enhanced in their usefulness,
      performance, reliability, and security.</p><p>Jails build upon the <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=chroot&amp;sektion=2&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">chroot</span>(2)</span></a> concept, which is used
      to change the root directory of a set of processes.  This
      creates a safe environment, separate from the rest of the
      system.  Processes created in the chrooted environment can not
      access files or resources outside of it.  For that reason,
      compromising a service running in a chrooted environment should
      not allow the attacker to compromise the entire system.
      However, a chroot has several limitations.  It is suited to easy
      tasks which do not require much flexibility or complex, advanced
      features.  Over time, many ways have been found to escape from a
      chrooted environment, making it a less than ideal solution for
      securing services.</p><p>Jails improve on the concept of the traditional chroot
      environment in several ways.  In a traditional chroot
      environment, processes are only limited in the part of the file
      system they can access.  The rest of the system resources,
      system users, running processes, and the networking subsystem
      are shared by the chrooted processes and the processes of the
      host system.  Jails expand this model by virtualizing access to
      the file system, the set of users, and the networking subsystem.
      More fine-grained controls are available for tuning the access
      of a jailed environment.  Jails can be considered as a type of
      operating system-level virtualization.</p><p>A jail is characterized by four elements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>A directory subtree: the starting point from which a
	  jail is entered.  Once inside the jail, a process is not
	  permitted to escape outside of this subtree.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A hostname: which will be used by the jail.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An <acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> address: which is assigned to
	  the jail.  The <acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> address of a jail is
	  often an alias address for an existing network
	  interface.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A command: the path name of an executable to run inside
	  the jail.  The path is relative to the root directory of the
	  jail environment.</p></li></ul></div><p>Jails have their own set of users and their own <code class="systemitem">root</code> account which are limited
      to the jail environment.  The <code class="systemitem">root</code> account of a jail is not
      allowed to perform operations to the system outside of the
      associated jail environment.</p><p>This chapter provides an overview of the terminology and
      commands for managing FreeBSD jails.  Jails are a powerful tool for
      both system administrators, and advanced users.</p><p>After reading this chapter, you will know:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>What a jail is and what purpose it may serve in FreeBSD
	  installations.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How to build, start, and stop a jail.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The basics of jail administration, both from inside and
	  outside the jail.</p></li></ul></div><div xmlns="" class="important"><h3 class="admontitle">Important: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jails are a powerful tool, but they are not a security
	panacea.  While it is not possible for a jailed process to
	break out on its own, there are several ways in which an
	unprivileged user outside the jail can cooperate with a
	privileged user inside the jail to obtain elevated privileges
	in the host environment.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of these attacks can be mitigated by ensuring that
	the jail root is not accessible to unprivileged users in the
	host environment.  As a general rule, untrusted users with
	privileged access to a jail should not be given access to the
	host environment.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="security-sudo.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="system-administration.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="jails-terms.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">13.14. Shared Administration with Sudo </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 14.2. Terms Related to Jails</td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

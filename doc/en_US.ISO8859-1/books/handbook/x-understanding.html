      of the various components in the X Window System and how they
      interact, some basic knowledge of these components can be
      useful.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">X server</span></dt><dd><p>X was designed from the beginning to be
	    network-centric, and adopts a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">client-server</span>&#8221;</span>
	    model.  In this model, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X server</span>&#8221;</span> runs on
	    the computer that has the keyboard, monitor, and mouse
	    attached.  The server's responsibility includes tasks such
	    as managing the display, handling input from the keyboard
	    and mouse, and handling input or output from other devices
	    such as a tablet or a video projector.  This confuses some
	    people, because the X terminology is exactly backward to
	    what they expect.  They expect the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X server</span>&#8221;</span>
	    to be the big powerful machine down the hall, and the
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X client</span>&#8221;</span> to be the machine on their
	    desk.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">X client</span></dt><dd><p>Each X application, such as
	    <span class="application">XTerm</span> or
	    <span class="application">Firefox</span>, is a
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">client</span>&#8221;</span>.  A client sends messages to the
	    server such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Please draw a window at these
	      coordinates</span>&#8221;</span>, and the server sends back messages
	    such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">The user just clicked on the OK
	      button</span>&#8221;</span>.</p><p>In a home or small office environment, the X server
	    and the X clients commonly run on the same computer.  It
	    is also possible to run the X server on a less powerful
	    computer and to run the X applications on a more powerful
	    system.  In this scenario, the communication between the X
	    client and server takes place over the network.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">window manager</span></dt><dd><p>X does not dictate what windows should look like
	    on-screen, how to move them around with the mouse, which
	    keystrokes should be used to move between windows, what
	    the title bars on each window should look like, whether or
	    not they have close buttons on them, and so on.  Instead,
	    X delegates this responsibility to a separate window
	    manager application.  There are <a class="link" href="http://www.xwinman.org/" target="_top">dozens of window
	      managers</a> available.  Each window manager provides
	    a different look and feel: some support virtual desktops,
	    some allow customized keystrokes to manage the desktop,
	    some have a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Start</span>&#8221;</span> button, and some are
	    themeable, allowing a complete change of the desktop's
	    look-and-feel.  Window managers are available in the
	    <code class="filename">x11-wm</code> category of the Ports
	    Collection.</p><p>Each window manager uses a different configuration
	    mechanism.  Some expect configuration file written by hand
	    while others provide graphical tools for most
	    configuration tasks.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">desktop environment</span></dt><dd><p><span class="application">KDE</span> and
	    <span class="application">GNOME</span> are considered to be
	    desktop environments as they include an entire suite of
	    applications for performing common desktop tasks.  These
	    may include office suites, web browsers, and games.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">focus policy</span></dt><dd><p>The window manager is responsible for the mouse focus
	    policy.  This policy provides some means for choosing
	    which window is actively receiving keystrokes and it
	    should also visibly indicate which window is currently
	    active.</p><p>One focus policy is called
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">click-to-focus</span>&#8221;</span>.  In this model, a window
	    becomes active upon receiving a mouse click.  In the
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">focus-follows-mouse</span>&#8221;</span> policy, the window that
	    is under the mouse pointer has focus and the focus is
	    changed by pointing at another window.  If the mouse is
	    over the root window, then this window is focused.  In the
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">sloppy-focus</span>&#8221;</span> model, if the mouse is moved
	    over the root window, the most recently used window still
	    has the focus.  With sloppy-focus, focus is only changed
	    when the cursor enters a new window, and not when exiting
	    the current window.  In the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">click-to-focus</span>&#8221;</span>
	    policy, the active window is selected by mouse click.  The
	    window may then be raised and appear in front of all other
	    windows.  All keystrokes will now be directed to this
	    window, even if the cursor is moved to another
	    window.</p><p>Different window managers support different focus
	    models.  All of them support click-to-focus, and the
	    majority of them also support other policies.  Consult the
	    documentation for the window manager to determine which
	    focus models are available.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">widgets</span></dt><dd><p>Widget is a term for all of the items in the user
	    interface that can be clicked or manipulated in some way.
	    This includes buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, icons,
	    and lists.  A widget toolkit is a set of widgets used to
	    create graphical applications.  There are several popular
	    widget toolkits, including Qt, used by
	    <span class="application">KDE</span>, and GTK+, used by
	    <span class="application">GNOME</span>.  As a result,
	    applications will have a different look and feel,
	    depending upon which widget toolkit was used to create the
	    application.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="x11.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="x11.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="x-install.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 5. The X Window System </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 5.3. Installing <span class="application">Xorg</span></td></tr></table></div><p xmlns="" align="center"><small>All FreeBSD documents are available for download

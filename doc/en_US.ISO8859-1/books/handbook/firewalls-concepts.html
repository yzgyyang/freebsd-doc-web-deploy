      packets based on the values contained in the packet.  The
      bi-directional exchange of packets between hosts comprises a
      session conversation.  The firewall ruleset processes both the
      packets arriving from the public Internet, as well as the
      packets produced by the system as a response to them.  Each
      <acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym> service is predefined by its protocol
      and listening port.  Packets destined for a specific service
      originate from the source address using an unprivileged port and
      target the specific service port on the destination address.
      All the above parameters can be used as selection criteria to
      create rules which will pass or block services.</p><p>To lookup unknown port numbers, refer to
      <code class="filename">/etc/services</code>.  Alternatively, visit <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers</a></code>
      and do a port number lookup to find the purpose of a particular
      port number.</p><p>Check out this link for <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150803024617/http://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/oddports.php" target="_top">port numbers used by Trojans</a></code>.</p><p>FTP has two modes:  active mode and passive mode.  The
      difference is in how the data channel is acquired.  Passive
      mode is more secure as the data channel is acquired by the
      ordinal ftp session requester.  For a good explanation of FTP
      and the different modes, see <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://www.slacksite.com/other/ftp.html" target="_top">http://www.slacksite.com/other/ftp.html</a></code>.</p><p>A firewall ruleset can be either
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">exclusive</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">inclusive</span>&#8221;</span>.  An
      exclusive firewall allows all traffic through except for the
      traffic matching the ruleset.  An inclusive firewall does the
      reverse as it only allows traffic matching the rules through and
      blocks everything else.</p><p>An inclusive firewall offers better control of the outgoing
      traffic, making it a better choice for systems that offer
      services to the public Internet.  It also controls the type of
      traffic originating from the public Internet that can gain
      access to a private network.  All traffic that does not match
      the rules is blocked and logged.  Inclusive firewalls are
      generally safer than exclusive firewalls because they
      significantly reduce the risk of allowing unwanted
      traffic.</p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unless noted otherwise, all configuration and example
	rulesets in this chapter create inclusive firewall
	rulesets.</p></div><p>Security can be tightened further using a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">stateful
	firewall</span>&#8221;</span>.  This type of firewall keeps track of open
      connections and only allows traffic which either matches an
      existing connection or opens a new, allowed connection.</p><p>Stateful filtering treats traffic as a bi-directional
      exchange of packets comprising a session.  When state is
      specified on a matching rule the firewall dynamically generates
      internal rules for each anticipated packet being exchanged
      during the session.  It has sufficient matching capabilities to
      determine if a packet is valid for a session.  Any packets that
      do not properly fit the session template are automatically
      rejected.</p><p>When the session completes, it is removed from the dynamic
      state table.</p><p>Stateful filtering allows one to focus on blocking/passing
      new sessions.  If the new session is passed, all its subsequent
      packets are allowed automatically and any impostor packets are
      automatically rejected.  If a new session is blocked, none of
      its subsequent packets are allowed.  Stateful filtering provides
      advanced matching abilities capable of defending against the
      flood of different attack methods employed by attackers.</p><p><acronym class="acronym">NAT</acronym> stands for <span class="emphasis"><em>Network
	Address Translation</em></span>.  <acronym class="acronym">NAT</acronym>
      function enables the private LAN behind the firewall to share a
      single ISP-assigned IP address, even if that address is
      dynamically assigned.  NAT allows each computer in the LAN to
      have Internet access, without having to pay the ISP for multiple
      Internet accounts or IP addresses.</p><p><acronym class="acronym">NAT</acronym> will automatically translate the
      private LAN IP address for each system on the LAN to the
      single public IP address as packets exit the firewall bound for
      the public Internet.  It also performs the reverse translation
      for returning packets.</p><p>According to RFC 1918, the following IP address ranges are
      reserved for private networks which will never be routed
      directly to the public Internet, and therefore are available
      for use with NAT:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">10.0.0.0/8</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">172.16.0.0/12</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">192.168.0.0/16</code>.</p></li></ul></div><div xmlns="" class="warning"><h3 class="admontitle">Warning: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When working with the firewall rules, be <span class="emphasis"><em>very
